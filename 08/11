Applying these ideas to the particular structures and\ndynamics of the brain, we have developed a detailed model of quantum\nconsciousness. We have also carried out experiments from the perspective of our\ntheory to test the possibility of quantum-entangling the quantum entities\ninside the brain with those of an external chemical substance. We found that\napplying magnetic pulses to the brain when an anaesthetic was placed in between\ncaused the brain to feel the effect of said anaesthetic as if the test subject\nhad actually inhaled the same. We further found that drinking water exposed to\nmagnetic pulses, laser light or microwave when an anaesthetic was placed in\nbetween also causes brain effects in various degrees. Additional experiments\nindicate that the said brain effect is indeed the consequence of quantum\nentanglement. Recently we have studied non-local effects in simple physics\nsystems. We have found that the pH value, temperature and gravity of a liquid\nin the detecting reservoirs can be non-locally affected through manipulating\nanother liquid in a remote reservoir quantum-entangled with the former. In\nparticular, the pH value changes in the same direction as that being\nmanipulated; the temperature can change against that of local environment; and\nthe gravity can change against local gravity. We suggest that they are mediated\nby quantum entanglement between nuclear and/or electron spins in treated liquid\nand discuss the profound implications of these results. This paper now also\nincludes materials on further development of the theory and related topics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Aug 2002 01:47:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2006 18:25:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2006 00:58:44 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 16 Nov 2006 18:53:56 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 8 Nov 2007 03:58:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-11-08"}
