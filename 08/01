The nonlinear evolution of the matter power\nspectra is compared with the predictions of existing analytic scaling formulae\nbased on the work of Hamilton et al. The scaling approach has assumed that\nhighly nonlinear structures obey `stable clustering' and are frozen in proper\ncoordinates. Our results show that, when transformed under the self-similarity\nscaling, the scale-free spectra define a nonlinear locus that is clearly\nshallower than would be required under stable clustering. Furthermore, the\nsmall-scale nonlinear power increases as both the power-spectrum index n and\nthe density parameter Omega decrease, and this evolution is not well accounted\nfor by the previous scaling formulae. This breakdown of stable clustering can\nbe understood as resulting from the modification of dark-matter haloes by\ncontinuing mergers. These effects are naturally included in the analytic `halo\nmodel' for nonlinear structure; using this approach we are able to fit both our\nscale-free results and also our previous CDM data.

Previous VLBI images at 1.6 GHz have\nset a lower limit for the jet/counterjet brightness ratio near the core at\nabout 80:1, which is larger than expected given the evidence that the radio\naxis is fairly close to the plane of the sky. A possible explanation is that\nthe inner few pc of the counterjet is hidden by free-free absorption by ionized\ngas associated with an accretion disk or torus. This would be consistent with\nthe nearly edge-on appearance of the arcsecond-scale dust disk seen in the\ncenter of NGC 6251 by HST. We detect counterjet emission close to the core at\n1.6 GHz, but not at the higher frequencies. Given that the optical depth of\nfree-free absorption falls off more rapidly with increasing frequency than the\noptically thin synchrotron emission from a typical radio jet, this result\nimplies that the absence of a detectable parsec-scale counterjet at high\nfrequencies is not due to free-free absorption unless the density of ionized\ngas is extremely high and we have misidentified the core at 1.6 GHz.

We conclude that low-velocity Galactic OVI absorption occurs along all\nsightlines - the few non-detections only occur in noisy spectra. We further\nshow that high-velocity OVI is very common, having equivalent width >65 mAA in\n50% of the sightlines and >30 mAA in 70% of the high-quality sightlines. The\nhigh-velocity OVI absorption has velocities relative to the LSR of\n+/-(100--330) km/s; there is no correlation between velocity and absorption\nstrength. We present 50 km/s wide OVI channel maps. These show evidence for the\nimprint of Galactic rotation. They also highlight two known HI high-velocity\nclouds (complex~C and the Magellanic Stream). The channel maps further show\nthat OVI at velocities <-200 km/s occurs along all sightlines in the region\nl=20-150, b<-30, while OVI at velocities >200 km/s occurs along all sightlines\nin the region l=180-300, b>20 (abbreviated).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2002 21:33:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

As the pair potential grows through the\nsuperconducting transition, each degenerate Landau level in the normal state\nsplits into quasiparticle bands in the magnetic Brillouin zone. This brings\nLandau-level broadening, which in turn leads to the extra dHvA oscillation\ndamping in the vortex state. We perform extensive numerical calculations for\nthree-dimensional systems with various gap structures.

The\nmeasure used was the volume element of the Bures metric (identically one-fourth\nthe statistical distinguishability [SD] metric). Here, making use of a\nnewly-developed (Euler angle) parameterization of the 4 x 4 density matrices\n(math-ph/0202002), we extend the analysis to the complete 15-dimensional convex\nset (C) of arbitrarily paired qubits -- the total SD volume of which is known\nto be \\pi^8 / 1680 = \\pi^8 / (2^4 3 5 7) = 5.64794. Using advanced quasi-Monte\nCarlo procedures (scrambled Halton sequences) for numerical integration in this\nhigh-dimensional space, we approximately (5.64851) reproduce that value, while\nobtaining an estimate of .416302 for the SD volume of separable states. We\nconjecture that this is but an approximation to \\pi^6 /2310 = \\pi^6 / (2 3 5 7\n11) = .416186. The ratio of the two volumes, 8 / (11 \\pi^2) = .0736881, would\nthen constitute the exact Bures/SD probability of separability. The SD area of\nthe 14-dimensional boundary of C is 142 \\pi^7 / 12285 = 142 \\pi^7 /(3^3 5 7 13)\n= 34.911, while we obtain a numerical estimate of 1.75414 for the SD area of\nthe boundary of separable states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2002 18:27:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2002 18:47:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2003 16:54:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It is shown that\n``strange'' weak values for projection operators (such as values less than\nzero) always correspond to inconsistent families of histories. It is argued\nthat using the ABL rule to obtain probabilities for counterfactual measurements\ncorresponding to those strange weak values gives inconsistent results. This\nproblem is shown to be remedied by using the conditional weight, or\npseudo-probability, obtained from the multiple-time application of Luders'\nRule. It is argued that an assumption of reverse causality (a form of time\nsymmetry) implies that weak values obtain, in a restricted sense, at the time\nof the weak measurement as well as at the time of post-selection. Finally, it\nis argued that weak values are more appropriately characterised as\nmultiple-time amplitudes than expectation values, and as such can have little\nto say about counterfactual questions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2002 18:15:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2002 06:32:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 2003 22:44:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In this\nframework there is the possibility of deducing the AC effect of a scalar\nparticle from the corresponding effect for a spinor particle. In 3+1 dimensions\nsuch a connection is not possible because the anomalous MDM is zero if\nsupersymmetry is an exact symmetry. However, in 2+1 dimensions it is possible\nto have an anomalous MDM even with exact supersymmetry.\n  Having demonstrated the relationship between the spinor and the scalar MDM,\nwe proceed to show that the scalar AC effect is uniquely defined. We then\ncompute the anomalous MDM at the one loop level, showing how the scalar form\narises in 2+1 dimensions from the coupling of the scalar to spinors. This model\nshows how an AC effect for a scalar can be generated for non-supersymmetric\ntheories, and we construct such a model to illustrate the mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2002 04:56:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Oct 2002 06:46:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 18 Feb 2003 05:38:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}
