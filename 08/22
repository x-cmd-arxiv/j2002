The disorder consists on a random modulation of the gap\nspacing transverse to the growth direction (tracks). We have performed\nexperiments varying average interface velocity and gap spacing, and measured\nthe scaling exponents. We have obtained beta=0.50, beta*=0.25, alpha=1.0,\nalpha_l=0.5, and z=2. When there is no fluid injection, the interface is driven\nsolely by capillary forces, and a higher value of beta around beta=0.65 is\nmeasured.

From a detailed study of the\nmotion of the oil--air interface we show that the anomaly is a consequence of\ndifferent local velocities over tracks plus the coupling in the motion between\nneighboring tracks. The anomaly disappears at high interface velocities, weak\ncapillary forces, or when the disorder is not sufficiently persistent in the\ngrowth direction. We have also observed the absence of scaling when the\ndisorder is very strong or when a regular modulation of the gap spacing is\nintroduced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2002 14:06:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-16"}

If quantum mechanics turns out to be a sufficiently\ncorrect description of the phenomena in the regime of classical, weak\ngravitation, one should observe the forming of quantized bound states in the\nvertical direction above a mirror. Already in a simplified view, the data of\nthe experiment provides strong evidence for the existence of such\ngravitationally bound quantized states. A successful quantum-mechanical\ndescription would then provide a convincing argument, that the socalled first\nquantization can be used for gravitation as an interaction potential, as this\nis widely expected. Furthermore, looking at the characteristic length scales of\nabout 10 mikron of such bound states formed by UCN, one sees, that a complete\nquantum mechanical description of this experiment additionally would enable one\nto check for possible modifications of Newtonian gravitation on distance scales\nbeing one order of magnitude below currently available tests [Ad00].

It is thus found that a smooth torus is transformed\ninto an intermittent SNA via a phase-dependent saddle-node bifurcation when it\ncollides with a new type of ``ring-shaped'' unstable set. Besides this\nintermittent transition, other transitions such as the interior, boundary, and\nband-merging crises may also occur through collision with the ring-shaped\nunstable sets. Hence the ring-shaped unstable sets play a central role for such\ndynamical transitions.

The nonunitary time evolution is visualized by\nthe aid of the Wigner function related to the vibrational state of the\nmolecule. The time scale of decoherence is much shorter than that of\ndissipation, and gives rise to states which are mixtures of localized states\nalong the phase space orbit of the corresponding classical particle. This\nbehavior is to a large extent independent of the coupling strength, the\ntemperature of the environment and also of the initial state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2002 12:20:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
