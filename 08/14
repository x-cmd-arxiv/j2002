In the non-magnetic case, stabilization requires a Bonnor-Ebert\ntruncation at a finite radius, which is not feasible for a single-temperature\nflow, unless it amounts to a shock, which is clearly a dynamical feature.\nInstead, in this case, cores must be dynamical entities that can either be\npushed into collapse, or else ``rebound'' towards the mean pressure and density\nas the parent cloud. Nevertheless, rebounding cores are delayed in their\nre-expansion by their own self-gravity. We give a crude estimate for the\nre-expansion time as a function of the closeness of the final compression state\nto the threshold of instability, finding typical values $\\sim 1$ Myr, i.e., of\nthe order of a few free-fall times. Our results support the notion that not all\ncores observed in molecular clouds need to be on route to forming stars, but\nthat instead a class of ``failed cores'' should exist, which must eventually\nre-expand and disperse, and which can be identified with observed starless\ncores. In the magnetic case, recent observational and theoretical work suggests\nthat all cores are critical or supercritical, and are thus qualitatively\nequivalent to the non-magnetic case. Our results support the notion that the\nentire star formation process is dynamical, with no intermediate hydrostatic\nstages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Aug 2002 17:22:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Aug 2003 17:29:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The solution is based on a\nnonlinear generally covariant theory of a metastable graviton that leads to a\nlarge-distance modification of gravity.\n  From the extra-dimensional standpoint the problem is solved due to the fact\nthat the four-dimensional vacuum energy curves mostly the extra space. The\nfour-dimensional curvature is small, being inversely proportional to a positive\npower of the vacuum energy. The effects of infinite-volume extra dimensions are\nseen by a brane-world observer as nonlocal operators.\n  From the four-dimensional perspective the problem is solved because the\nzero-mode graviton is extremely weakly coupled to localized four-dimensional\nsources. The observable gravity is mediated not by zero mode but, instead, by a\nmetastable graviton with a lifetime of the order of the present-day Hubble\nscale. Therefore, laws of gravity are modified in the infrared above the Hubble\nscale. Large wave-length sources, such as the vacuum energy, feel only the\nzero-mode interaction and, as a result, curve space very mildly. Shorter\nwave-length sources interact predominantly via exchange of the metastable\ngraviton. Because of this, all standard properties of early cosmology,\nincluding inflation, are intact.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Aug 2002 02:23:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

The work extends\nthe shock matching theory of Smoller and Temple, which characterizes solutions\nof the Einstein equations when the spacetime metric is only Lipschitz\ncontinuous across a hypersurface, to the lightlike case. After a brief\nintroduction to general relativity, we develop the extension of a shock\nmatching theory after introducing a previously known generalization of the\nsecond fundamental form by Barrabes and Israel. In the development of the\ntheory we demonstrate that the matching of the generalized second fundamental\nform alone is not a sufficient condition for conservation conditions to hold\nacross the interface. We then use this theory to construct a new exact solution\nof the Einstein equations that can be interpreted as an outgoing spherical\nshock wave that propagates at the speed of light. The solution is constructed\nby matching a Friedman Robertson Walker (FRW) metric, which is a geometric\nmodel for the universe, to a Tolman Oppenheimer Volkoff (TOV) metric, which\nmodels a static isothermal spacetime. The sound speeds, on each side of the\nshock, are constant and sub-luminous. Furthermore, the pressure and density are\nsmaller at the leading edge of the shock, which is consistent with the Lax\nentropy condition in classical gas dynamics. However, the shock speed is\ngreater than all the characteristic speeds. The solution also yields a\nsurprising result in that the solution is not equal to the limit of previously\nknown subluminous solutions as they tend to the speed of light.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Aug 2002 22:51:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The\ndevelopment of quantum measurement theory, initiated by von Neumann, and Bell's\nconceptual critics of hidden variable theories indicated a possibility for\nresolution of this crisis. This can be done by divorcing the algebra of the\ndynamical generators and an extended algebra of the potential (quantum) and the\nactual (classical) observables.
