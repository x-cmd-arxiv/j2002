We show that in this case, the\nvolume of HI cleared per SN is considerably greater than in either of the two\ncases considered hitherto.\n  We derive a simple relationship between the ``porosity'' of the ISM and the\nstar formation rate (SFR), and deduce a critical SFR_crit, at which the ISM\nporosity is unity. This critical value describes the case in which the SN\nmechanical energy output over a timescale t_e is comparable with the ISM\n``thermal'' energy contained in random motions; t_e is the duration of SN\nmechanical input per superbubble. This condition also defines a critical gas\nconsumption timescale t_exh, which for a Salpeter IMF and random velocities of\n\\simeq 10 km s-1 is roughly 10e10 years.\n  We draw a link between porosity and the escape of ionising radiation from\ngalaxies, arguing that high escape fractions are expected if SFR >~ SFR_crit.\nThe Lyman Break Galaxies, which are presumably subject to infall on a timescale\n< t_exh, meet this criterion, as is consistent with the significant leakage of\nionising photons inferred in these systems.
