A new integro-differential equation for the\ncurrent distribution in a wire is obtained, which is valid for the surface\nimpedance matrix of a general form. In the vicinity of the antenna resonance,\nthe dispersion behaviour of the effective permittivity can depend strongly on a\ndc external magnetic field applied to the whole composite sample, experiencing\na transformation from a resonant spectrum to a relaxation one. If the\nresonance-like dispersion behaviour is realised, the real part of the effective\npermittivity can be made negative past the resonance for sufficiently small\nwire-inclusion concentrations (well below the percolation threshold). Applying\na dc external magnetic field, the negative peak of the real part of effective\npermittivity continuously decreases as the dispersion tends to become of a\nrelaxation type. The magnetic field required to cause these changes in the\neffective permittivity is of the order of the anisotropy field, that is, in the\nrange of few Oe for Co-based microwires. The field dependence of the effective\npermittivity arises from a high sensitivity of the ac surface impedance of a\nferromagnetic wire to a magnetic field (known as the magneto-impedance (MI)\neffect).

As input data to the FF we use the\nlinearized augmented plane wave method (LAPW) with the generalized gradient\napproximation (GGA) to calculate: (i) the zero temperature equation of state\n(EOS) of Ta for bcc, fcc, and hcp crystal structures for pressures up to ~500\nGPa. (ii) Elastic constants. (iii) We use a mixed-basis pseudopotential code to\ncalculate volume relaxed vacancy formation energy also as a function of\npressure. In developing the Ta FF we also use previous QM calculations of: (iv)\nthe equation of state for the A15 structure. (v) the surface energy bcc (100).\n(vi) energetics for shear twinning of the bcc crystal. We find that\nwithappropriate parameters an embedded atom model force field (denoted as qEAM\nFF) is able to reproduce all this QM data. Thus, the same FF describes with\ngood accuracy the bcc, fcc, hcp and A15 phases of Ta for pressures from ~ -10\nGPa to \\~ 500 GPa, while also describing the vacancy, surface energy, and shear\ntransformations.

To identify stable phases\nin the p-Omega plane (p: pressure; Omega: angular velocity), the functional is\nminimized with the Landau-level expansion method using up to 3000 Landau\nlevels. This system can sustain various exotic vortices by either (i) shifting\nvortex cores among different components or (ii) filling in cores with\ncomponents not used in the bulk. In addition, the phase near the upper critical\nangular velocity Omega_{c2} is neither the A nor B phases, but the polar state\nwith the smallest superfluid density as already shown by Schopohl. Thus,\nmultiple phases are anticipated to exist in the p-Omega plane.

The magnetic\nstructure-dependent impedance tensor is calculated for any frequency and\nexternal magnetic field, and is not restricted to the case when only strong\nskin-effect is present.

However, since the work of Richard Feynman in the early 1980s\nlittle progress was made in practical quantum simulation. Most researchers\nfocused on polynomial-time simulation of restricted types of quantum circuits\nthat fall short of the full power of quantum computation. Simulating quantum\ncomputing devices and useful quantum algorithms on classical hardware now\nrequires excessive computational resources, making many important simulation\ntasks infeasible. In this work we propose a new technique for gate-level\nsimulation of quantum circuits which greatly reduces the difficulty and cost of\nsuch simulations. The proposed technique is implemented in a simulation tool\ncalled the Quantum Information Decision Diagram (QuIDD) and evaluated by\nsimulating Grover's quantum search algorithm. The back-end of our package,\nQuIDD Pro, is based on Binary Decision Diagrams, well-known for their ability\nto efficiently represent many seemingly intractable combinatorial structures.\nThis reliance on a well-established area of research allows us to take\nadvantage of existing software for BDD manipulation and achieve unparalleled\nempirical results for quantum simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2002 19:55:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It is well-known\nthat the causal effect cannot be identified if not all patients comply. This\nholds even when the non-compliers can be identified afterwards since latent\nfactors like patient's personality can influence both his decision and his\nphysical response. However, one can still give bounds on the effectiveness of\nthe drug depending on the rate of compliance. Remarkably, the proofs of these\nbounds given in the literature rely on models that represent all relevant\nlatent factors (including noise) by hidden classical variables. In strong\nanalogy to the violation of Bell's inequality, some of these bounds fail if\npatient's behavior is influenced by latent quantum processes (e.g. in his\nnervous system). Quantum effects could fake an increase of the recovery rate by\nabout 13% although the drug would hurt as many patients as it would help if\neveryone took it. The other bounds are true even in the quantum case.\n  We do not present any realistic model showing this effect, we only point out\nthat the physics of decision making could be relevant for the causal\ninterpretation of every-day life statistical data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2002 17:28:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-03"}

In the case of two qubits we point out that the fully entangled\nfraction can also be related to the fidelities, maximized under the actions of\nlocal unitary operations, of other important quantum information tasks such as\ndense coding, entanglement swapping and quantum cryptography in such a way as\nto provide an inclusive measure of these entanglement applications.

This provides a phenomenological basis\nfor a physical resolution to the so-called \"measurement problem.\" Such models\nhave experimentally testable differences from standard quantum theory. The most\nwell developed such model at present is the Continuous Spontaneous Localization\n(CSL) model in which a fluctuating classical field interacts with particles to\ncause collapse. One \"side effect\" of this interaction is that the field imparts\nmomentum to particles, causing a small blob of matter to undergo random walk.\nHere we explore this in order to supply predictions which could be\nexperimentally tested. We examine the translational diffusion of a sphere and a\ndisc, and the rotational diffusion of a disc, according to CSL. For example, we\nfind that a disc of radius 2 cdot 10^{-5} cm and thickness 0.5 cdot 10^{-5} cm\ndiffuses through 2 pi rad in about 70sec (this assumes the \"standard\" CSL\nparameter values). The comparable rms diffusion of standard quantum theory is\nsmaller than this by a factor 10^-3. At the reported pressure of < 5\ncdot10^{-17} Torr, achieved at 4.2^{circ} K, the mean time between air molecule\ncollisions with the disc is approximately 45min (and the diffusion caused by\nphoton collisons is utterly negligible). This is ample time for observation of\nthe putative CSL diffusion over a wide range of parameters.\n  This encourages consideration of how such an experiment may actually be\nperformed, and the paper closes with some thoughts on this subject\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2002 19:12:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}
