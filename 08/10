The\nmethod combines ground-based photometry of caustic-crossing bulge microlensing\nevents, with a handful of precise astrometric measurements of the lensed star\nduring the event, to measure the angular radius of the source, theta_*. Dense\nphotometric coverage of one caustic crossing yields the crossing timescale dt.\nLess frequent coverage of the entire event yields the Einstein timescale t_E\nand the angle phi of source trajectory with respect to the caustic. The\nphotometric light curve solution predicts the motion of the source centroid up\nto an orientation on the sky and overall scale. A few precise astrometric\nmeasurements therefore yield theta_E, the angular Einstein ring radius. Then\nthe angular radius of the source is obtained by theta_*=theta_E(dt/t_E)\nsin(phi).

We\nargue that the observed correlation is a natural consequence of the Keplerian\ndisk flow adjustment to the innermost sub-Keplerian boundary conditions near\nthe central object. In the framework of the transition layer model the high\nfrequency is related to the Keplerian frequency at the outer (adjustment)\nradius and the low frequency is related to the magnetoacoustic oscillation (MA)\nfrequency.

We find the observed\nline ratios can best be reproduced by assuming that the H2 is fluoresced in a\nlayer between the observer and Mira B with a temperature and column density of\nT=3600 K and log N(H2)=17.3, respectively. The strengths of H2 absorption\nfeatures within the Ly-alpha line are roughly consistent with this temperature\nand column.
