It is difficult to derive the total far-infrared\nluminosity from only the IRAS data, though it is one of the most important\nproperties of galaxies. Observations by Infrared Telescope in Space (IRTS)\nindicate that the SED of the diffuse emission from the Galactic plane in this\nwavelength region can be derived from the 60 microns to 100 microns color. This\nempirical SED relation was improved in order to obtain a better fit to the\nGalactic plane data for I(60 microns)/I(100 microns) > 0.6, and applied to 96\nIRAS galaxies for which ISOPHOT and KAO data are available at lambda > 100\nmicrons. As a result, the empirical relation describes well the far-infrared\n(FIR) SED for a majority of the galaxies. Additionally, the total FIR flux for\nlambda longer than 40 microns is derived from the flux densities at 60 and 100\nmicrons by using this model. For the 96 IRAS galaxies, the uncertainty in the\ntotal far-infrared flux of the present method is 26%. The present method is\nmore accurate than the previous one widely used to derive the total infrared\nflux from the IRAS 60 and 100 microns data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Aug 2002 19:11:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

Previous studies have shown that for\nshallow surveys with median redshifts z_m = 0.1, the intrinsic alignment\ndominates the lensing signal. For deep surveys with z_m = 1, intrinsic\nalignments are believed to be a significant contaminant of the lensing signal,\npreventing high-precision measurements of the matter power spectrum. In this\npaper we show how distance information, either spectroscopic or photometric\nredshifts, can be used to down-weight nearby pairs in an optimised way, to\nreduce the errors in the shear signal arising from intrinsic alignments.\nProvided a conservatively large intrinsic alignment is assumed, the optimised\nweights will essentially remove all traces of contamination. For the Sloan\nspectroscopic galaxy sample, residual shot noise continues to render it\nunsuitable for weak lensing studies. However, a dramatic improvement for the\nslightly deeper Sloan photometric survey is found, whereby the intrinsic\ncontribution, at angular scales greater than 1 arcminute, is reduced from about\n80 times the lensing signal to a 10% effect. For deeper surveys such as the\nCOMBO-17 survey with z_m = 0.6, the optimisation reduces the error from a\nlargely systematic 220% error at small angular scales to a much smaller and\nlargely statistical error of only 17% of the expected lensing signal.

We explicitly demonstrate how the KPZ-term\nis always generated, even in the limit of vanishing velocity, except where\nexcluded by symmetry. We compute the beta-function to one loop taking properly\ninto account the non-analyticity. This gives rise to additional terms, missed\nin earlier studies. A crucial question is whether the non-renormalization of\nthe KPZ-coupling found at 1-loop order extends beyond the leading one. Using a\nCole-Hopf-transformed theory we argue that it is indeed uncorrected to all\norders. The resulting flow-equations describe a variety of physical situations.\nA careful analysis of the flow yields several non-trivial fixed points. All\nthese fixed points are transient since they possess one unstable direction\ntowards a runaway flow, which leaves open the question of the upper critical\ndimension. The runaway flow is dominated by a Landau-ghost-mode. For SR\nelasticity, using the Cole-Hopf transformed theory we identify a non-trivial\n3-dimensional subspace which is invariant to all orders and contains all above\nfixed points as well as the Landau-mode. It belongs to a class of theories\nwhich describe branching and reaction-diffusion processes, of which some have\nbeen mapped onto directed percolation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Aug 2002 22:17:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

This is done by amplitude modulating\nthe pump with a low frequency, and therefore, unlike previous studies, the\nspectrum of the modulated pump is, in all cases, smaller than the SBS\nbandwidth. We show both theoretically and experimentally that unlike phase\nmodulation, which was reported in the literature, the amplitude modulation\nincreases the Brillouin amplifier gain, and that this effect has a very narrow\nbandwidth. Only modulation frequencies that are lower than a certain cut-off\nfrequency increase the gain. This cut-off frequency is inversely proportional\nto the fiber's length, and can therefore be arbitrarily small.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 2002 07:01:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2002 06:49:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Through this example we\nare able to illustrate in detail how a quantum system responds to an energy\nperturbation, and the mechanism, according to the stochastic evolutionary law,\nby which the system relaxes spontaneously into one of the stable eigenstates of\nthe Hamiltonian. We examine in particular how the expectation value of the\nHamiltonian and the probability distribution for the position of the particle\nchange in time.
