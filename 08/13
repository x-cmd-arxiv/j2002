The first method is\nbased on the isolation of the red clump giant population in the color-magnitude\ndiagrams and the inversion of its star counts to obtain directly the density\ndistribution along the line of sight. The second method fits the parameters of\na disc model to the star counts in 820 regions. Results from both independent\nmethods are consistent with each other. The qualitative conclusions are that\nthe disc is well fitted by an exponential distribution in both the\ngalactocentric distance and height. There is not an abrupt cut-off in the\nstellar disc (at least within R<15 kpc). There is a strong flare (i.e. an\nincrease of scale-height towards the outer Galaxy) which begins well inside the\nsolar circle, and hence there is a decrease of the scale-height towards the\ninner Galaxy. Another notable feature is the existence of a warp in the old\nstellar population whose amplitude is coincident with the amplitude of the gas\nwarp.\n  It is shown for low latitude stars (mean height: |z|~300 pc) in the outer\ndisc (galactocentric radius R>6 kpc) that: the scale-height in the solar circle\nis h_z(R_sun)=3.6e-2 R_sun, the scale-length of the surface density is h_R=0.42\nR_sun and the scale-length of the space density in the plane (i.e. including\nthe effect of the flare) is H=0.25 R_sun.

Our approach is based on a dynamical ``Cosmological\nConstant'' and the starting point is that a decaying vacuum produces matter. As\nwe point out, such a dynamical Lambda is not incompatible with the general\nrequirements of general relativity. By assuming inflation and big bang\nnucleosynthesis we can solve for the present fractional densities of matter\nOmega_{m,0} and vacuum Omega_{Lambda, 0} in terms of only one parameter which\nwe call the vacuum domination crossing redshift, z_c. We put constraints on z_c\nto obtain a universe that is presently vacuum dominated and with characteristic\ndensities consistent with observations. The model points to the possible\nexistence of newly formed dark matter in the inter-cluster voids. We argue that\nsome of this matter could be accreting onto clusters through the latter's long\nrange gravitational potentials. If so, then cluster dark matter halos may not\nmanifest clear cut-offs in their radial density profiles. Furthermore, if a\nsubstantial amount of this newly produced matter has already drained onto the\nclusters, then the CMB power spectrum may favor lower dark matter density\nvalues than is currently observed bound in the clusters. A final feature of our\napproach relates to the combined effect of the matter production by a decaying\nvacuum and the different rates at which matter and the vacuum will dilute with\nthe scale factor. Such combination may create conditions for a universe in\nwhich the vacuum and matter densities dilute and evolve towards comparable\namplitudes. In this sense the model offers a natural and conceptually simple\nexplanation to the Coincidence Problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Aug 2002 06:05:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-13"}

The Hestenesian 'dot' product, extending the\none-vector scalar product, is even worse having exceptions for scalars and the\nneed for applying grade operators at various times.

The situation becomes even\nworse in geometric applications if a meet, join or contractions have to be\ncalculated.\n  Starting from a naturally graded Grassmann Hopf gebra, we derive general\nformulae for the products: meet and join, comeet and cojoin, left/right\ncontraction, left/right cocontraction, Clifford and co-Clifford products.

The only input is the defining equation\nof each projected curve. We show how both the embeddings and the curve in CP^3\ncan be recovered modulo some actions of the group of projective transformations\nof CP^3. For two projections, we show how in a generic situation, a\ncharacteristic matrix of the two embeddings can be recovered. We also establish\nthe minimal number of irreducible algebraic curves required to compute this\ncharacteristic matrix up to a finite-fold ambiguity, as a function of their\ndegree and genus. Then we use this matrix to recover the class of the couple of\nmaps and as a consequence to recover the curve. Then we consider another\nproblem. N projections, with known projections operators and N >> 1, are\nconsidered as an input and we want to recover the curve. The recovery can be\ndone by linear computations in the dual space and in the Grassmannian of lines\nin CP^3. A closely related question is also considered. Each point of a finite\nclosed subset of an irreducible algebraic curve, is projected onto a plane from\na different point. The projections operators are known. We show when and how\nthe recovery of the algebraic curve is possible, in function of the degree of\nthe curve of minimal degree generated by the centers of projection. A second\npart is devoted to applications to computer vision. The results in this paper\nsolve a long standing problem in computer vision that could not have been\nsolved without algebraic-geometric methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Aug 2002 15:14:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
