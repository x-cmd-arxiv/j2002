However, the\ncollisional excitation rates of the helium resonance lines are unusually\nsensitive to the energy of the exciting electrons. Non-thermal motions in the\ntransition region could drive slowly-ionizing helium ions rapidly through the\nsteep temperature gradient, exposing them to excitation by electrons\ncharacteristic of higher temperatures than those describing their ionization\nstate. We present the results of calculations which use a more physical\nrepresentation of the lifetimes of the ground states of He I and He II than was\nadopted in earlier work on this process. New emission measure distributions are\nused to calculate the temperature variation with height. The results show that\nnon-thermal motions can lead to enhancements of the He I and He II resonance\nline intensities by factors that are comparable with those required. Excitation\nby non-Maxwellian electron distributions would reduce the effects of\nnon-thermal transport. The effects of non-thermal motions are more consistent\nwith the observed spatial distribution of helium emission than are those of\nexcitation by non-Maxwellian electron distributions alone. In particular, they\naccount better for the observed line intensity ratio I(537.0 A)/I(584.3 A), and\nits variation with location.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Aug 2002 08:50:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

This area proportionality of\nhorizon associated entropy has to be compared to the volume dependence of\nordinary heat bath entropy.

When stochastic phenomena are taken into account the\namplitude of oscillations will drift and eventually one and then two of the\nthree species will become extinct. The second model remains stationary for all\ninitial conditions in the mean field approximation, and drifts when stochastic\nphenomena are considered. We analyzed the distribution of first extinction\ntimes of both models by simulations and from the point of view of the\nFokker-Planck equation. Survival probability vs. time plots suggest an\nexponential decay. For the neutral model the extinction rate is inversely\nproportional to the system size, while the cyclic model exhibits anomalous\nbehaviour for small system sizes. In the large system size limit the extinction\ntimes for both models will be the same. This result is compatible with the\nsmallest eigenvalue obtained from the numerical solution of the Fokker-Planck\nequation. We also studied the long--time behaviour of the probability\ndistribution. The exponential decay is found to be robust against certain\nchanges, such as the three reactions having different rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Aug 2002 20:20:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Feb 2003 19:48:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 28 Feb 2003 21:27:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We report new insights into the problem\nof the domain of the Vogel-Fulcher-Tamman (VFT) equation, raised by Stickel et\nal. (J. Chem.

The primary relaxation is\ndescribed by the VFT equation below the crossover temperature T_c (known from\nmode coupling theory (MCT)), and above T_c by an extended (VFTE) equation\nobtained after accounting for cluster-size fluctuations. The timescale is\nparametrized by a finite number of observable parameters such as the steepness\nfunction m_T, the MCT slowing-down exponent gamma_c, and the VFT and VFTE\nstrength indices D_g and D_c.
