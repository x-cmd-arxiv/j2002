The present paper\nprovides an extension of the algebraic theory to include the case when $M$ is\nnot necessarily a progenerator. Our approach is complementary to recent work of\nDwyer and Greenlees and of Schwede and Shipley. A central notion of\nnoncommutative ring theory related to Morita equivalence is that of central\nseparable or Azumaya algebras. For such an Azumaya algebra A, its Hochschild\ncohomology HH^*(A,A) is concentrated in degree 0 and is equal to the center of\nA. We introduce a notion of topological Azumaya algebra and show that in the\ncase when the ground S-algebra R is an Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectrum of a\ncommutative ring this notion specializes to classical Azumaya algebras. A\ncanonical example of a topological Azumaya R-algebra is the endomorphism\nR-algebra F_R(M,M) of a finite cell R-module. We show that the spectrum of mod\n2 topological K-theory KU/2 is a nontrivial topological Azumaya algebra over\nthe 2-adic completion of the K-theory spectrum widehat{KU}_2.
