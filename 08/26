To\nunderstand and maintain the improvements to the delivered image quality since\nthe completion of the upgrades programme, we have regularly monitored the\noverall atmospheric seeing, as measured by radial displacements of subaperture\nimages (i.e. seeing-generated focus fluctuations), and the delivered image\ndiameters. The latter have been measured and recorded automatically since the\nbeginning of 2001 whenever the facility imager UFTI (UKIRT Fast Track Imager)\nhas been in use.\n  In this paper we report the results of these measurements. We investigate the\nrelation between the delivered image diameter and the RMS atmospheric seeing\n(as measured by focus fluctuations, mentioned above). We find that the best\nseeing occurs in the second half of the night, generally after 2am HST and that\nthe best seeing occurs in the summer between the months of July and September.\nWe also find that the relationship between Zrms and delivered image diameter is\nuncertain. As a result Zrms frequently predicts a larger FWHM than that\nmeasured in the images.\n  Finally, we show that there is no correlation between near-infrared seeing\nmeasured at UKIRT and sub-mm seeing measured at the Caltech Submillimetre\nObservatory (CSO).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Aug 2002 22:18:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

It has been long believed that the orbit suffers circularization\ndue to the dynamical friction from the galactic halo during orbital decay. This\ncircularization was confirmed by numerous simulations where dynamical friction\nis added as external force. However, some of the resent N-body simulations\ndemonstrated that circularization is much slower than expected from approximate\ncalculations. We found that the dominant reason for this discrepancy is the\nassumption that Coulomb logarithm log Lambda is constant, which has been used\nin practically all recent calculations. Since the size of the satellite is\nrelatively large, accurate determination of the outer cutoff radius is crucial\nto obtain good estimate for the dynamical friction. An excellent agreement\nbetween $N$-body simulations and approximate calculations was observed when the\nouter cutoff radius is taken to be the distance of the satellite to the center\nof the galaxy. When satellite is at the perigalacticon, the distance to the\ncenter is smaller and therefore log Lambda becomes smaller.
