These\nsimulations bring forth the possibility of addressing another question; namely\nwhether stars such as Betelgeuse may harbor magnetic activity. Taking the\ndetailed numerical simulations of the star at face value, we have applied a\nkinematic dynamo analysis, to study whether the flow field of the super-giant\nmay be able to amplify a weak seed magnetic field. We do indeed find a positive\nexponential growth rate of the magnetic energy. The possible Betelgeusian\ndynamo may be characterized as belonging to the class of so-called ``local\nsmall-scale dynamos'' (i.e. dynamos where rotation is not dominant), but this\nis a less meaningful designation in the case of Betelgeuse, since the field is\nboth global and large-scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Aug 2002 08:49:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

These ULIGs are further distinguished by the presence of pairs of active\nnuclei; among the ten nuclei, nine have Seyfert or LINER classifications and\none is unclassified. Molecular gas is detected only on the redder, more\nradio-luminous nucleus of the warm objects, whereas both nuclei of the cool\nULIGs are detected in CO. The inferred molecular gas masses for the detected\nnuclei are 0.1-1.2x10^10 M_sun, and the undetected nuclei have molecular gas\nmasses at least 1.2--2.8 times less than that of their CO-luminous companions.\nUpper limits on the extent of the CO emitting regions of each detected nucleus\nrange from 2--4 kpc, which is about 3-6 times smaller than the average\neffective CO diameter of nearby spiral galaxies...\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Aug 2002 15:29:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The proposed universal quantum gates\nare constructed with the help of Heisenberg- and Ising-type Hamiltonians acting\non these physical qubits. This way it is guaranteed that the relevant error\ncorrecting code space is not left at any time even during the application of\none of these quantum gates. The proposed entanglement gate is particularly well\nsuited for scalable quantum processing units whose elementary registers are\nbased on four-qubit systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Aug 2002 16:46:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Aug 2002 12:57:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In addition\nto being minimum uncertainty states, as the size of the spin, S, increases, the\nclassical nature is seen to increase in two respects: in their resistance to\nentanglement generation (when passed through a beam splitter) and in the\ndistinguishability of the states. In the infinite S limit the spin coherent\nstate is a subclass of the optical coherent states (namely the subclass of\northogonal optical coherent states). These states generate no entanglement and\nare obviously completely distinguishable. The decline of the generated\nentanglement, and in this sense increase in classicality with S, is very slow\nand dependent on the amplitude z of the state. Surprisingly we find that for\n|z| > 1 there is an initial increase in entanglement followed by an extremely\ngradual decline to zero. The distinguishability, on the other hand, quickly\nbecomes classical for all z. We illustrate the distinguishability of spin\ncoherent states in a novel manner using the representation of Majorana.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Aug 2002 19:14:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 Sep 2002 16:14:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 20 Jul 2003 22:10:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
