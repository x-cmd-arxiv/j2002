In this paper, we point out that such spectral fitting can have very\nlarge uncertainties with respect to predictions of the VHE emission. This is\ndemonstrated with the example of W Comae. We show that the best currently\navailable contemporaneous optical - X-ray spectrum of W Comae still allows for\na large range of possible parameters, resulting in drastically different > 40\nGeV fluxes. We find that all acceptable leptonic-model fits to the optical -\nX-ray emission of W Comae predict a cut-off of the high-energy emission around\n~ 100 GeV. We suggest that detailed measurements and analysis of the soft X-ray\nvariability of W Comae may be used to break the degeneracy in the choice of\npossible fit parameters, and thus allow a more reliable prediction of the VHE\nemission from this object. Using the available soft X-ray variability measured\nby BeppoSAX, we predict a > 40 GeV flux from W Comae of ~ (0.4 - 1) * 10^{-10}\nphotons/(cm^2 s) with no significant emission at E > 100 GeV for a leptonic jet\nmodel. We compare our results concerning leptonic jet models with detailed\npredictions of the hadronic Synchrotron-Proton Blazar model. This hadronic\nmodel predicts > 40 GeV fluxes very similar to those found for the leptonic\nmodels, but results in > 100 GeV emission which should be clearly detectable\nwith future high-sensitivity instruments like VERITAS. Thus, we suggest this\nobject as a promising target for VHE gamma-ray and co-ordinated broadband\nobservations to distinguish between leptonic and hadronic jet models for\nblazars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2002 23:03:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

For the\nslow mode, B^2 ~= c_1-c_2 rho, while for the fast mode, B^2 ~= rho^2. We also\nperform a perturbative analysis to investigate Alfven wave pressure, recovering\nprevious results that B^2 ~= rho^gamma_e, with gamma_e ~= 2, 3/2 and 1/2 at\nrespectively large, moderate and low M_a. This variety of scalings implies that\na single polytropic description of magnetic pressure is not possible in\ngeneral, since the relation between B^2 and rho depends on which mode dominates\nthe density fluctuation production, which in turn depends on the angle between\nthe magnetic field and the direction of wave propagation, and on the Alfvenic\nMach number M_a. Typically, at small M_a, the slow mode dominates, and B is\nANTIcorrelated with rho. At large M_a, both modes contribute to density\nfluctuation production, and the magnetic pressure decorrelates from density,\nexhibiting a large scatter, which however decreases towards higher densities.\nIn this case, the unsystematic behavior of the magnetic pressure causes the\ndensity PDF to generally maintain the lognormal shape corresponding to\nnon-magnetic isothermal turbulence, except when the slow mode dominates, in\nwhich case the PDF develops an excess at low densities. Our results are\nconsistent with the low values and apparent lack of correlation between the\nmagnetic field strength and density in surveys of the lower-density molecular\ngas, and also with the recorrelation apparently seen at higher densities, if\nM_a is relatively large there.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2002 01:13:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In that article he considers a manifold\nX and a negatively embedded submanifold A subset X. He introduces\nn-neighborhood, n in N, of A and studies when an isomorphism of two\nn-neighborhoods can be extended to an isomorphism of (n+1)-neighborhoods. He\nobserves that obstructions to this extension problem lie in the first\ncohomology group of certain sheaves involving the normal bundle of A in X.\nUsing a version of Kodaira vanishing theorem he shows that for a large n these\ncohomology groups vanish and so he concludes that the germ of a negatively\nembedded manifold A depends only on a finite neighborhood of it. These methods\nare generalized to a germ of an arbitrary negatively embedded divisor A by\nHironaka, Rossi and Laufer. In the case where A is a Riemann surface embedded\nin a two dimensional manifold, by using Serre duality we can say exactly which\nfinite neighborhood of A determines the embedding.\n  This isa first draft of an expository article about negatively embedded\nvarieties. The text is mainly based on Grauert's paper, but we have used also\nthe contributions of subsequent authors; for instance the Artin's criterion on\nthe existence of convergent solutions is used instead of Grauert's geometrical\nmethods. Our principal aim is to extend this study to the germ of foliated\nneighborhoods and singularities. In the first steps we will consider the most\nsimple foliations which are transversal foliations.

Plasticity of these maps has been studied in\nowls forced to wear prismatic spectacles that shift their visual field.\nAdaptive behavior in young owls is accompanied by a compensating shift in the\nresponse of (mapped) neurons to auditory signals. We model the receptive fields\nof such neurons by linear filters that sample correlated audio-visual signals,\nand search for filters that maximize the gathered information, while subject to\nthe costs of rewiring neurons. Assuming a higher fidelity of visual\ninformation, we find that the corresponding receptive fields are robust and\nunchanged by artificial shifts. The shape of the aural receptive field,\nhowever, is controlled by correlations between sight and sound. In response to\nprismatic glasses, the aural receptive fields shift in the compensating\ndirection, although their shape is modified due to the costs of rewiring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2002 20:14:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
