This well-studied case is the first example in which it has\nfinally been possible to separate the intrinsic redshift component from the\ncosmological and other Doppler components. It is shown that this leads to\nintrinsic redshift components that occur at exact multiples of z = 0.062 and\nare defined by the relation zi = 0.062[10N - M] where N and M can have only\ncertain discrete values. It is also shown that the intrinsic redshifts given by\nthis relation and others obtained for different N and M-values, agree closely\nwith the redshifts found to be preferred in analyses of quasar emission-line\nredshifts. It is now apparent that the peaks in the distribution of quasar\nemission line redshifts also occur at pure harmonics of z = 0.062. Although\nthese peaks have previously been fitted by a log(1+z) relation, the above\nexplanation now seems more appropriate. These results indicate that the\nDelta(z) = 0.062 redshift interval, long known to be present in QSO\nemission-line redshifts below z = 0.6, is also present in an intrinsic\ncomponent of QSO redshifts up to z ~ 2.

The results are based on a set of 10 echelle spectra, monitoring the star\non time scales of months, days and hours. A large number of transient\nblueshifted and redshifted absorption features are detected in the Balmer and\nin many metallic lines.

Unlike previously proposed\nschemes, our architecture avoids expensive mechanisms such as global flooding\nas well as complex coordination between nodes to form a hierarchy. CARD is also\nindependent of any external source of information such as GPS. In our\narchitecture nodes within a limited number of hops from each node form the\nneighborhood of that node. Resources within the neighborhood can be readily\naccessed with the help of a proactive scheme within the neighborhood. For\naccessing resources beyond the neighborhood, each node also maintains a few\ndistant nodes called contacts. Contacts help in creating a small world in the\nnetwork and provide an efficient way to query for resources beyond the\nneighborhood. As the number of contacts of a node increases, the network view\n(reachability) of the node increases. Paths to contacts are validated\nperiodically to adapt to mobility. We present mechanisms for contact selection\nand maintenance that attempt to increase reachability while minimizing\noverhead. Our simulation results show a clear trade-off between increase in\nreachability on one hand, and contact selection and maintenance overhead on the\nother. Our results suggest that CARD can be configured to provide a desirable\nreachability distribution for different network sizes. Comparisons with other\nschemes for resource discovery, such as flooding and bordercasting, show our\narchitecture to be much more efficient and scalable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Aug 2002 17:21:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The current Mobile IP (MIP) standard has been shown\nto exhibit poor handover performance. Most other work attempts to modify MIP to\nslightly improve its efficiency, while others propose complex techniques to\nreplace MIP. Rather than taking these approaches, we instead propose a new\narchitecture for providing efficient and smooth handover, while being able to\nco-exist and inter-operate with other technologies. Specifically, we propose an\nintra-domain multicast-based mobility architecture, where a visiting mobile is\nassigned a multicast address to use while moving within a domain. Efficient\nhandover is achieved using standard multicast join/prune mechanisms. Two\napproaches are proposed and contrasted. The first introduces the concept\nproxy-based mobility, while the other uses algorithmic mapping to obtain the\nmulticast address of visiting mobiles. We show that the algorithmic mapping\napproach has several advantages over the proxy approach, and provide mechanisms\nto support it. Network simulation (using NS-2) is used to evaluate our scheme\nand compare it to other routing-based micro-mobility schemes - CIP and HAWAII.\nThe proactive handover results show that both M&M and CIP shows low handoff\ndelay and packet reordering depth as compared to HAWAII. The reason for M&M's\ncomparable performance with CIP is that both use bi-cast in proactive handover.\nThe M&M, however, handles multiple border routers in a domain, where CIP fails.\nWe also provide a handover algorithm leveraging the proactive path setup\ncapability of M&M, which is expected to outperform CIP in case of reactive\nhandover.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Aug 2002 18:04:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We find that the effect\nof absorption, along with geometric considerations, explains much of the\nenhancement at low invariant mass seen in recent data for invariant mass\nspectra with increasing atomic number. While the variation among nuclei is well\nreproduced for all charge states, the enhancement for the ratio for heavy\nnuclei to deuterium for the pi^+ pi^- final state is only partially understood.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Aug 2002 19:05:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

In order to damp the wakefields to\nacceptable levels for travelling wave structures we detune the frequencies of\nthe cells and we couple out the field to four adjacent manifolds. Optimizing\nthe manifold-cell coupling for several hundred cells and changing the bandwidth\nparameters of the distribution has in previous structures been achieved by a\nprocess of trial and error. Here, we report on an optimized Fortran code that\nhas been specifically written with the aim minimizing the sum of the squares of\nthe RMS and standard deviation of the sum wakefield. Sparse matrix techniques\nare employed to reduce the computational time required for each frequency step.\nThe wakefield is minimized whilst ensuring that no significant local surface\nheating occurs due to slots cuts into the accelerator cells to couple out the\nwakefield.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Aug 2002 01:43:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
