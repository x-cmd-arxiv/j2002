The polarizability has a maximum\nfor a chain length equal to half of the circumference of the colloid. For long\nchains we recover the polarizability of a classical conducting sphere.

A key point is that for moderately clean samples, the mean\nfree path becomes comparable to coherence length of the smaller gap over its\nentire Fermi surface. In this case, quasiparticle excitations bound in vortex\ncores can easily be delocalized causing a rapid rise in the thermal\nconductivity at low magnetic fields. This feature is in marked contrast to that\nfor anisotropic or nodal gaps, where delocalization occurs only on part of the\nFermi surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2002 13:43:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2002 18:22:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Based on\nthis effect, a readout concept for silicon based solid-state spin--quantum\ncomputers as proposed by Kane is suggested. The 31P quantum bit (qbit) is\nconnected via hyperfine coupling to the spin of the localized donor electron.\nWhen a second localized and singly occupied electronic state with an energy\nlevel deep within the band gap or close to the valence edge is in proximity, a\ngate controlled exchange between the 31P nucleus and the two electronic states\ncan be activated that leaves the donor-deep level pair either unchanged in a\n|T->-state or shifts it into a singlet state |S>. Since the donor deep level\ntransition is spin-dependent, the deep level becomes charged or not, depending\non the nuclear spin orientation of the donor nucleus. Thus, the state of the\nqbit can be read with a sequence of light pulses and photo conductivity\nmeasurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2002 15:13:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
