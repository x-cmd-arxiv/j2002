The images confirm the galaxy to be extremely\nsmall, with a maximum extent of only 300 pc, a luminosity ~ 10^-4 L*, and an\nestimated mass ~ 10^7 M(sun). Its morphology is highly asymmetric, with a tail\nof material on its western side that may be tidal in origin. The U-band image\nshows this tail to be part of a stream of material in which stars have recently\nformed. Most of the star formation in the galaxy is however concentrated in a\ncentral, compact (d ~ 10 - 15 pc) star cluster. The outer regions of the galaxy\nare significantly redder than the cluster, with V - I colors consistent with a\npopulation dominated by K and M stars. While these results rule out earlier\nspeculation that POX 186 is a protogalaxy, its morphology, mass and active star\nformation suggest that it represents a recent (within ~ 10^8 yr) collision\nbetween two clumps of stars of sub-galactic size (~ 100 pc). POX 186 may thus\nbe a very small dwarf galaxy that, dynamically speaking, is still in the\nprocess of formation.

We regularly\nachieve a spatial resolution of 0.05'' and are thus able to resolve both the\ndisk and bulge components. We have extracted morphological information for ten\ngalaxies and compared their properties to those of a local sample. The\nselection effects of both samples were explicitly taken into account in order\nto derive the unbiased result that disks at z~0.5 are ~0.6 mag arcsec^-2\nbrighter than, and about the same size as, local disks. The\nno-luminosity-evolution case is ruled out at 90% confidence. We also find, in a\nmore qualitative analysis, that the bulges of these galaxies have undergone a\nsmaller amount of surface brightness evolution and have also not changed\nsignificantly in size from z~0.5 to today. This is the first time this type of\nmorphological evolution has been measured in the infrared and it points to the\nunique power of AO in exploring galaxy evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Aug 2002 23:12:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The method is very simple: lossy quantization followed\nby lossless compression using general-purpose compression tools such as gzip\nand bzip2. A key feature of the method is that compressed images can be\nconverted to FITS files simply by decompressing with gunzip or bunzip2, and\nthis is a significant advantage for distributing compressed files. The degree\nof quantization is chosen to eliminate low-order bits that over-sample the\nnoise, contain no information, and are difficult or impossible to compress. The\nmethod is lossy but gives guarantees on the maximum absolute difference, the\nexpected mean difference, and the expected RMS difference between the\ncompressed and original images; these guarantees make it suitable for use on\nraw images. The method consistently compresses images to roughly 1/5 of their\noriginal size with a quantization such that no value changes by more than 1/2\nof a standard deviation in the background. This is a dramatic improvement on\nlossless compression. It appears that bzip2 compresses the quantized images to\nwithin a few tens of percent of the theoretical limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Aug 2002 23:58:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Here we report the\nfirst such study, an examination of the fluctuations in personal income of\nabout 80,000 high-income taxpayers in Japan for two consecutive years, 1997 and\n1998, when the economy was relatively stable. We find that the distribution of\nthe growth rate in one year is independent of income in the previous year. This\nfact, combined with an approximate time-reversal symmetry, leads to the Pareto\nlaw, thereby explaining it as a consequence of a stable economy.
