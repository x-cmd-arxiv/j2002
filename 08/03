Our measurements show that [SiVI] 1.963mu,\n[SIX] 1.252mu and [SVIII] 0.991mu are present in most of the objects and are\nuseful tracers of nuclear activity. Line ratios between coronal and low\nionization forbidden lines are larger in narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies. A\npositive correlation between FHWM and ionization potential of the forbidden\nlines is observed. Some coronal lines have widths similar to that of lines\nemitted in the broad line region (BLR), indicating that part of their flux\noriginates in gas close to the outer portions of the BLR. Most coronal lines\nare blueshifted relative to the systemic velocity of the galaxy and this shift\nincreases with the increase in line width. Assymetries towards the blue are\nobserved in the profiles of high-ionization Fe lines, suggesting that the\nemitting gas is related to winds or outflows, most probably originating in\nmaterial that is being evaporated from the torus. This scenario is supported by\nmodels that combine the effects of shock ionization and photoionization by a\ncentral continuum source in the gas clouds. The agreement between the coronal\nline emission predicted by the models and the observations is satisfactory; the\nmodels reproduced the whole range of coronal line intensities observed. We also\nreport the detection of [FeXIII] 1.074,1.079mu in three of our objects and the\nfirst detection of [PII] 1.188mu and [NiII] 1.191mu in a Seyfert 1 galaxy, ARK\n564. Using the ratio [PII]/[FeII] we deduced that most Fe present in the outer\nNLR of ARK 564 is locked up in grains, and the influence of shocks is\nnegligible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Aug 2002 19:12:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
