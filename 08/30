Our halos are in\napproximate virial equilibrium and roughly isothermal, as in CDM simulations.\nTheir density profiles agree quite well with the fit to N-body results for CDM\nhalos by Navarro, Frenk, & White (NFW). This test-bed model enables us to study\nthe evolution of individual halos. The masses of our halos evolve in three\nstages: an initial collapse, continuous infall, and a final stage in which\ninfall tapers off as a result of finite mass supply. In the continuous infall\nstage, halo mass grows at the rate expected for self-similar spherical infall,\nwith M(a) proportional to the scale factor a.

Within the last few\nmillion years, new stars have been produced at an accelerating rate, almost\nexclusively within a confined group of striated cloud filaments. The gas both\ninside and around the filaments appears to be in force balance. Thus, the\nappearance of the filaments is due to global, quasi-static contraction of the\nparent cloud material. Gravity drives this contraction and shock dissipation\nmediates it, but the internal motion of the gas does not appear to be\nturbulent. The accelerating nature of recent star formation means that the\ncondensation of cloud cores is a threshold phenomenon, requiring a minimum\nbackground density. Other, nearby cloud regions, including Lupus and\nChamaeleon, contain some locales that have attained this density, and others\nthat have not. In the latter, we find extensive and sometimes massive molecular\ngas that is still devoid of young stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Aug 2002 00:25:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The EUV data interpretation,\nin particular, has suffered because of inadequate neutral hydrogen-plasma\nmodels, difficulty of calculating the multiply scattered Lyman alpha glow and\ncalibration uncertainties.

We complement here the\n1999 Chalonge Lectures on out of equilibrium fields in self-consistent\ninflationary dynamics [astro-ph/0006446] investigating inflation driven by the\nevolution of highly excited quantum states. These states are characterized by a\nnon-perturbatively large number of quanta in a band of momenta and with zero or\nnonzero expectation value of the inflaton scalar field. They represent the\nsituation in which initially a non-perturbatively large energy density is\nlocalized in a band of high energy quantum modes and are coined tsunami-waves.\nThe self- consistent evolution of this quantum state and the scale factor is\nstudied analytically and numerically. It is shown that the time evolution of\nthese quantum states lead to two consecutive stages of inflation under\nconditions that are the quantum analogue of slow-roll. The evolution of the\nscale factor during the first stage has new features that are characteristic of\nthe quantum state. During this initial stage the quantum fluctuations in the\nhighly excited band build up an effective homogeneous condensate with a\nnon-perturbatively large amplitude as a consequence of the large number of\nquanta.The second stage of inflation is similar to the usual classical chaotic\nscenario but driven by this effective condensate.The excited quantum modes are\nsuperhorizon in the first stage and do not affect the power spectrum of scalar\nperturbations.Thus, this tsunami quantum state provides a field theoretical\njustification for chaotic scenarios driven by a classical homogeneous scalar\nfield of large amplitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Aug 2002 13:23:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Both are clearly seen in the NMR spectra measured in a magnetic\nfield of 7T. Above T_{CO} there exists only one NMR line with a large isotropic\nshift, whose temperature dependence is in accordance with the presence of\nferromagnetic (FM) correlations. This line splits into two parts below T_{CO},\nwhich are attributed to different types of oxygen in the charge/orbital ordered\nstate. The interplay of FM and AF spin correlations of Mn ions in the charge\nordered state of Pr_{0.5} Ca_{0.5} MnO_3 is considered in terms of the hole\nhopping motion that is slowed down with decreasing temperature. The developing\nfine structure of the spectra evidences, that there still exist\ncharge-disordered regions at T_{CO} > T > T_N and that the static (t >\n10^{-6}s) orbital order is established only on approaching T_N. The CE-type\nmagnetic correlations develop gradually below T_{CO}, so that at first the AF\ncorrelations between checkerboard ab-layers appear, and only at lower\ntemperature - CE correlations within the ab-planes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Aug 2002 09:01:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

As a prelude to\ncosmology we study magnetogenesis in Minkowski space-time in a theory of N\ncharged scalar fields to lowest order in the gauge coupling and to leading\norder in the large N within two scenarios of cosmological relevance. The\nlong-wavelength power spectrum for electric and magnetic fields at the end of\nthe phase transition is obtained explicitly.\n  It follows that equipartition between electric and magnetic fields does not\nhold out of equilibrium. In the case of a transition from a high temperature\nphase, the conductivity of the medium severely hinders the generation of\nmagnetic fields, however the magnetic fields generated are correlated on scales\nof the order of the domain size, which is much larger than the magnetic\ndiffusion length.

A density matrix treatment is required for two reasons.\nThe first arises because the particles initially are not in a pure state due to\nthermal motion. The second reason is that each particle interacts with the\nmagnetic field and the other particles, with the latter taken to be via a\n2-body central force. The equations for the 1-body Wigner distribution\nfunctions are written in a general manner, and the places where quantum\nmechanical effects can play a role are identified. One that may not have been\nconsidered previously concerns the momentum associated with the magnetic field\ngradient, which is proportional to the time integral of the gradient. Its\nrelative magnitude compared with the important momenta in the problem is a\nsignificant parameter, and if their ratio is not small some non-classical\neffects contribute to the solution.\n  Assuming the field gradient is sufficiently small, and a number of other\ninequalities are satisfied involving the mean wavelength, range of the force,\nand the mean separation between particles, we solve the integro- partial\ndifferential equations for the Wigner functions to second order in the strength\nof the gradient. When the same reasoning is applied to a different problem with\nno field gradient, but having instead a gradient to the z-component of\npolarization, the connection with the diffusion coefficient is established, and\nwe find agreement with the classical result for the rate of decrease of the\ntransverse component of magnetization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Aug 2002 16:58:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The approach is based on a simple wire grid and can be scaled to\nprovide large arrays of periodically arranged magnetic or magneto-optical\ntraps. The unit cells of the trap lattices are based on crossed wire segments.\nBy alternating the current directions in the wires of the grid it can be\ndistinguished between 3 basic lattice configurations. As a first demonstration,\nwe used macroscopic wires in a 2 layer configuration to realize the unit cells\nof the lattices. With this experimental setup, we observe two of the basic unit\ncells and an array of 2x2 magneto optical traps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Aug 2002 15:58:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Dec 2002 16:21:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 13 Mar 2003 13:19:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
