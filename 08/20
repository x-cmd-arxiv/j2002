On the contrary, in one of the few systems where the\nrelative orientations are well-constrained, V4641Sgr, the jet axis is known to\nlie not more than ~36 degrees from the binary plane. Such a jet, lying close to\nthe binary plane, and traveling at a significant fraction of the speed of light\nmay periodically impact the secondary star initiating nuclear reactions on its\nsurface. The integrated yield of such nuclear reactions over the age of the\nbinary system (less the radiative mass loss) will detectably alter the\nelemental abundances of the companion star. This scenario may explain the\nanomalously high Li enhancements (roughly ~20-200 times the sun's photospheric\nvalue; or, equivalently, 0.1-1 times the average solar system value) seen in\nthe companions of some black-hole X-ray binary systems. (Such enhancements are\npuzzling since Li nuclei are exceedingly fragile - being easily destroyed in\nthe interiors of stars - and Li would be expected to be depleted rather than\nenhanced there.) Gamma-ray line signatures of the proposed process could\ninclude the 2.22 MeV neutron capture line as well as the 0.478 MeV 7Li*\nde-excitation line, both of which may be discernable with the INTEGRAL\nsatellite if produced in an optically thin region during a large outburst.

Our\nexperience shows that there are two classes of problems, which we call\nalgorithmic and search problems, for which logic programming can help formulate\npractical solutions.

If there\nwas exactly one single consistent method of synchronizing clocks, or if all\ncorresponding methods were equivalent, one could infer from the validity of\nspecial relativity theory on a definite value of the one-way speed of light c\nin inertial frames.\n  It is true that sufficiently slowly separated clocks always show middle in\ntime reflection when sending and receiving light signals. But a simple\nconsideration proves that the one-way speed of light is not a constant in\nrotating systems, in principle detectable with only one clock.\n  On basis of a new internal synchronization method, this also affects all\nlocal inertial frames on rotating Earth, too, violating an absolute constancy\nof the one-way speed of light. This is not a contradiction to Einstein's\noriginal theory of relativity but to the present definition of the meter.
