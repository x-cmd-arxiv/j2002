The model disks\nare local, isothermal, and begin from a vertically-stratified equilibrium. We\nfirst construct axisymmetric equilibria and examine their stability. Finite\ndisk thickness reduces the critical Toomre Q parameter below unity; we find Q_c\n\\~ 0.75, 0.72, and 0.57 for \\beta=\\infty, 10, and 1 cases, respectively. We\nthen pursue fully 3D models. In non-self-gravitating cases, the peak density\nenhancement from the `pure' Parker instability is less a factor of two. The\ndominant growing modes have radial wavelengths comparable to the disk scale\nheight H, much shorter than the azimuthal wavelength (~10-20 H). Shearing\ndisks, being more favorable to midplane-symmetric modes, have somewhat\ndifferent late-time magnetic field profiles from nonshearing disks, but\notherwise saturated states are similar. Late-time velocity fluctuations at 10%\nof the sound speed persist, but no characteristic structural signatures of\nParker modes remain in the new equilibria. In self-gravitating cases, the\ndevelopment of density structure is qualitatively similar to our previous\nresults from thin-disk simulations. The Parker instability, although it may\nhelp seed structure or tip the balance under marginal conditions, appears to\nplay a secondary role. In shearing disks with Q less than a threshold level ~\n1, swing amplification can produce bound clouds of a few times the local Jeans\nmass. The most powerful cloud-condensing mechanism appears to be the MJI. Our\nsimulations show that condensations of a local Jeans mass (~3\\times 10^7 M_sun)\ngrow very rapidly, supporting the idea that MJI is at least partly responsible\nfor the formation of bound cloud complexes in spiral galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2002 16:25:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

This makes the\nsystem an excellent candidate for a high-quality determination of H_0 at\ncosmological distances. However, the original measurements of the time delays\nhad large (12-20%) uncertainties, due to the low level of variability of the\nbackground source during the monitoring campaign. In this paper, we present\nresults from two additional VLA monitoring campaigns. In contrast to the ~5%\nvariations seen during the first season of monitoring, the source flux density\nchanged by 25-30% in each of the subsequent two seasons. We analyzed the\ncombined data set from all three seasons of monitoring to improve significantly\nthe precision of the time delay measurements; the delays are consistent with\nthose found in the original measurements, but the uncertainties have decreased\nby factors of two to three. We combined the delays with revised isothermal mass\nmodels to derive a measurement of H_0. Depending on the positions of the galaxy\ncentroids, which vary by up to 0.1 arcsec in HST images obtained with different\nfilters, we obtain H_0 = 61-65 km/s/Mpc, for (Omega_M,Omega_L) = (0.3,0.7).

The formal\nuncertainties on H_0 due to the time delay measurements are +/- 1 (+/- 2)\nkm/s/Mpc for the 1-sigma (2-sigma) confidence limits. Thus, the systematic\nuncertainties due to the lens model, which are on the order of +/- 15 km/s/Mpc,\nnow dominate the error budget for this system.

To this effect we make a critical study of the wave\nmechanics of two hard core quantum particles and discover its several untouched\naspects, viz.: (i) the useful details of \\psi_k(r) (representing the relative\nmotion of two particles), (ii) the expectation value of hard core (HC)\nrepulsion (<V_{HC}(r)>), (iii) the inconsistency of the statements, r \\le\\sigma\nand \\psi_k(r \\le\\sigma)=0 (\\sigma=HC diameter of a particle), with uncertainty\nprinciple particularly for low k values, (iv) the lower bound of allowed values\nof k=2q, (v) the dominance of interparticle phase correlation in low\ntemperature phase. For the first time this study concludes that <V_{HC}(r)> has\nzero value which does not agree with its non-zero value known for the last\nseveral decades. This also finds compelling reasons for a system of interacting\nbosons such as liquid ^4He to have (q, -q) pair condensation with allowed q,\nobviously controlled by V_{HC}(r), to satisfy q \\ge\\pi/d. Several important\naspects of N body quantum systems like liquids ^4He and ^3He are also\nconcluded. Free from any error [see editor's note J. Scientific Exploration\n16(1), p.1 (2002)], our approach can help in developing nearly exact\nmicroscopic theories of widely different systems of interacting bosons and\nfermions, as demonstrated for liquids ^4He type systems [J. Scientific\nExploration, 16, 77-116 (2002)]. The paper also sums up the expert observations\nwith our response to facilitate one to have a critical assessment and better\nunderstanding of the new approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Aug 2002 06:56:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The present study addresses both\nattractive and repulsive interactions, with a particular emphasis on the\ndescription of clustering phenomena from a thermodynamical as well as from a\ndynamical point of view. The observed clustering transition can be first or\nsecond order, in the usual thermodynamical sense.

In particular, in the\nmicrocanonical ensemble negative specific heat regimes and temperature jumps\nare observed. Moreover, having access to dynamics one can study non-equilibrium\nprocesses. Among them, the most striking is the emergence of coherent\nstructures in the repulsive model, whose formation and dynamics can be studied\neither by using the tools of statistical mechanics or as a manifestation of the\nsolutions of an associated Vlasov equation.

Several decomposition experiments were\nperformed at various temperatures and under various annealing atmospheres,\nunder flowing gas as well as in sealed tubes, in order to study the appropriate\nconditions for Bi,Pb(2223) formation from the melt.

The Chern-Simons term\nis introduced here to provide masses for the particles while remaining totally\nwithin a supersymmetric context. We examine the free, weak and strong-coupling\nspectrum.
