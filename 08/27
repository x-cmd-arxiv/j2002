These simulations, performed in a\n2.5 dimensional time-dependent polytropic resistive MHD framework, model a\nresistive accretion disk threaded by an initial vertical magnetic field. The\nresistivity is only important inside the disk, and is prescribed as eta =\nalpha_m V_AH exp(-2Z^2/H^2), where V_A stands for Alfven speed, H is the disk\nscale height and the coefficient alpha_m is smaller than unity. By performing\nthe simulations over several tens of dynamical disk timescales, we show that\nthe launching of a collimated outflow occurs self-consistently and the ejection\nof matter is continuous and quasi-stationary. These are the first ever\nsimulations of resistive accretion disks launching non-transient ideal MHD\njets. Roughly 15% of accreted mass is persistently ejected. This outflow is\nsafely characterized as a jet since the flow becomes super-fastmagnetosonic,\nwell-collimated and reaches a quasi-stationary state. We present a complete\nillustration and explanation of the `accretion-ejection' mechanism that leads\nto jet formation from a magnetized accretion disk. In particular, the magnetic\ntorque inside the disk brakes the matter azimuthally and allows for accretion,\nwhile it is responsible for an effective magneto-centrifugal acceleration in\nthe jet. As such, the magnetic field channels the disk angular momentum and\npowers the jet acceleration and collimation. The jet originates from the inner\ndisk region where equipartition between thermal and magnetic forces is\nachieved. A hollow, super-fastmagnetosonic shell of dense material is the\nnatural outcome of the inwards advection of a primordial field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Aug 2002 16:27:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Here we present results from Monte Carlo simulations, showing the\nspace-time evolution of secondary electron cascades in diamond. These cascades\nfollow the impact of a single primary electron at energies between 0.5-12 keV,\nrepresenting the usual range for photoelectrons. The calculations describe the\nsecondary ionizations caused by these electrons, the three-dimensional\nevolution of the electron cloud, and monitor the equivalent instantaneous\ntemperature of the free-electron gas as the system cools during expansion. The\ndissipation of the impact energy proceeds predominantly through the production\nof secondary electrons whose energies are comparable to the binding energies of\nthe valence (40-50 eV) and the core electrons (300 eV) in accordance with\nexperiments and the models of interactions.

This\nbelief is not justified in general. It is put to rest here in the context of\nthe general framework for alpha variability [J. D. Bekenstein, Phys. Rev. D 25,\n1527 (1982)] in which the exponent of a scalar field plays the role of the\npermittivity and inverse permeability of the vacuum. The coupling of particles\nto the scalar field is necessarily such that the anomalous force acting on a\ncharged particle by virtue of its mass's dependence on the scalar field is\ncancelled by terms modifying the usual Coulomb force. As a consequence a\nparticle's acceleration in external fields depends only on its charge to mass\nratio, in accordance with the principle. And the center of mass acceleration of\na composite object can be proved to be independent of the object's internal\nconstitution, as the weak equivalence principle requires. Likewise the widely\nemployed assumption that the Coulomb energy of matter is the principal source\nof the scalar field proves wrong; Coulomb energy effectively cancels out in the\ncontinuum description of the scalar field's dynamics. This cancellation\nresolves a cosmological conundrum: with Coulomb energy as source of the scalar\nfield, the framework would predict a decrease of alpha with cosmological\nexpansion, whereas an increase is claimed to be observed. Because of the said\ncancellation, magnetic energy of cosmological baryonic matter is the main\nsource of the scalar field. Consequently the expansion is accompanied by an\nincrease in alpha; for reasonable values of the framework's sole parameter,\nthis occurs at a rate consistent with the observers' claims.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Aug 2002 05:26:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Dec 2002 14:31:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
