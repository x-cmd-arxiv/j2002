Basically, they argue that free\nwill is possible because there is an ontological indeterminism in the natural\nlaws, and that the mind is responsible for the wave function collapse of\nmatter, which leads to a choice among the different possibilities for the body.\nHowever, I defend the opposite thesis, that free will cannot be defended in\nterms of QM. First, because indeterminism does not imply free will, it is\nmerely a necessary condition but not enough to defend it. Second, because all\nconsiderations about an autonomous mind sending orders to the body is against\nour scientific knowledge about human beings; in particular, neither\nneurological nor evolutionary theory can admit dualism. The quantum theory of\nmeasurement can be interpreted without the intervention of human minds, but\nother fields of science cannot contemplate the mentalist scenario, so it is\nconcluded that QM has nothing to say about the mind or free will, and its\nscientific explanation is more related to biology than to physics. A fatalistic\nor materialist view, which denies the possibility of a free will, makes much\nmore sense in scientific terms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Aug 2002 13:38:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-07"}
