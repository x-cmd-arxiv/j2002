The objects are classified as Galilean and non-Galilean. Three types\nof non-Galilean objects are considered: spinning, rigid, and dressed particles.\nIn the absence of external forces, such particles are capable of executing not\nonly uniform motions along straight lines but also Zitterbewegungs,\nself-accelerations, self-decelerations, and uniformly accelerated motions. A\nfree non-Galilean object possesses the four-velocity and the four-momentum\nwhich are in general not collinear, therefore, its inert properties are\nspecified by two, rather than one, invariant quantities. It is shown that a\nspinning particle need not be a non-Galilean object. The necessity of a rigid\nmechanics for the construction of a consistent classical electrodynamics in\nspacetimes of dimension D+1 is justified for D+1>4. The problem of how much the\nform of fundamental laws of physics orders four dimensions of our world is\nrevised together with its solution suggested by Ehrenfest.
