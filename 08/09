Automated classification and parameterization work best when\napplied to a homogeneous data set, and thus these techniques primarily have\nbeen developed for and applied to large surveys.

We briefly summarize past work on automated\nclassification and parameterization, with emphasis on the work done in our\ngroup. Accurate automated classification in the spectral type domain and\nparameterization in the temperature domain have been relatively easy. Automated\nparameterization in the metallicity domain, formally outside the MK system, has\nalso been effective. Due to the subtle effects on the spectrum, automated\nclassification in the luminosity domain has been somewhat more difficult, but\nstill successful. In order to extend the use of automated techniques beyond a\nfew surveys, we present our current efforts at building a web-based automated\nstellar spectroscopic classification and parameterization machine. Our proposed\nmachinery would provide users with MK classifications as well as the\nastrophysical parameters of effective temperature, surface gravity, mean\nabundance, abundance anomalies, and microturbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2002 16:17:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We discuss the\nemission mechanisms that may be responsible for these observations.\n  On our preferred model, the X-ray emission from the radio lobes of the three\nsources is due to inverse-Compton scattering of the microwave background\nradiation. If this is the case, the magnetic field strengths in the lobes are\ntypically about a factor 2 below the equipartition values, assuming uniform\nlobe electron and magnetic field distributions.\n  We detect extended X-ray emission, which we attribute to a cluster/group\nenvironment, around 3C263 and 3C330.

As the magnetization exponent $\\beta$ is more easily\ndistinguishable from zero in four dimensions than in three dimensions, these\nresults provide a useful test of conventional scaling theories. Results are\npresented for the critical behavior of the heat capacity, magnetization, and\nstiffness. The fractal dimensions of the domain walls at criticality are\nestimated. A notable difference from three dimensions is the structure of the\nspin domains: frozen spins of both signs percolate at a disorder magnitude less\nthan the value at the ferromagnetic to paramagnetic transition. Hence, in the\nvicinity of the transition, there are two percolating clusters of opposite\nspins that are fixed under any boundary conditions. This structure changes the\ninterpretation of the domain walls for the four dimensional case. The scaling\nof the effect of boundary conditions on the interior spin configuration is\nfound to be consistent with the domain wall dimension. There is no evidence of\na glassy phase: there appears to be a single transition from two ferromagnetic\nstates to a single paramagnetic state, as in three dimensions.

Our purpose in this chapter is to provide an intuitive explanation\nfor the observed I-V characteristics using simple models to illustrate the\nbasic physics. In contrast to the MOSFET, whose I-V is largely dominated by\nclassical electrostatics, the I-V characteristics of molecules is determined by\na more interesting interplay between nineteenth century physics\n(electrostatics) and twentieth century physics (quantum transport) and it is\nimportant to do justice to both aspects.\n  We start with a qualitative discussion of the main factors affecting the I-V\ncharacteristics of molecular conductors, using a simple toy model to illustrate\ntheir role. Including the effects of: (1) Shift in the energy level due to\ncharging effects and (2) broadening of the energy levels due to the coupling to\nthe two contacts we obtain realistic I-V plots, even though the toy model\nassumes that conduction takes place independently through individual molecular\nlevels. In general, however, the full non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF)\nformalism is needed. Here, we describe the NEGF formalism as a generalized\nversion of the one-level model. This formalism provides a convenient framework\nfor describing quantum transport and can be used in conjunction with ab initio\nor semi-empirical Hamiltonians.

Experimental\nconsequences of this conceptual tension will be explored for macroscopically\ncoherent quantum fluids, such as superconductors, superfluids, and atomic\nBose-Einstein condensates (BECs), subjected to tidal and Lense-Thirring fields\narising from gravitational radiation. A Meissner-like effect is predicted, in\nwhich the Lense-Thirring field is expelled from the bulk of a quantum fluid.\nSuperconductors are predicted to be macroscopic quantum gravitational antennas\nand transducers, which can directly convert upon reflection a beam of\nquadrupolar electromagnetic radiation into gravitational radiation, and vice\nversa, and thus serve as both sources and receivers of gravitational waves. An\nestimate of the transducer conversion efficiency on the order of unity comes\nout of the Ginzburg-Landau theory for an extreme type II, dissipationless\nsuperconductor with minimal coupling to weak gravitational and electromagnetic\nradiation fields, whose frequency is smaller than the BCS gap frequency, thus\nsatisfying the quantum adiabatic theorem. The concept of ``the impedance of\nfree space for gravitational plane waves'' is introduced, and leads to a\nnatural impedance-matching process, in which the two kinds of radiation fields\nare impedance-matched to each other around a hundred coherence lengths beneath\nthe surface of the superconductor.

Such a lower bound was first introduced by Lov\\'asz in 1978,\nin his famous proof of the \\emph{Kneser conjecture} via Algebraic Topology.\nThis conjecture stated that the \\emph{Kneser graph} $\\KG_{m,n}$, the graph with\nall $k$-element subsets of $\\{1,2,...,n\\}$ as vertices and all pairs of\ndisjoint sets as edges, has chromatic number $n-2k+2$. Several other proofs\nhave since been published (by B\\'ar\\'any, Schrijver, Dolnikov, Sarkaria, Kriz,\nGreene, and others), all of them based on some version of the Borsuk--Ulam\ntheorem, but otherwise quite different. Each can be extended to yield some\nlower bound on the chromatic number of an arbitrary graph. (Indeed, we observe\nthat \\emph{every} finite graph may be represented as a generalized Kneser\ngraph, to which the above bounds apply.)\n  We show that these bounds are almost linearly ordered by strength, the\nstrongest one being essentially Lov\\'asz' original bound in terms of a\nneighborhood complex.
