The dividing line N_crit(Omega) between configurations with one\nand two phases is correlated to a local maximum of the moment of inertia and\ncan thus be subject to experimental verification by observation of the\nrotational behavior of accreting compact stars. Another characteristic line,\nwhich also can be measured is the transition line to black holes that of the\nmaximum mass configurations. The positions and the shape of these lines are\nsensitive to changes in the equation of state (EoS) of stellar matter. A\ncomparison of the regional structure of phase diagrams is performed for\npolytropic and relativistic mean field type EoS and correlations between the\ntopology of the transition lines and the properties of two-phase EoS are\nobtained. Different scenarios of compact star evolution are discussed as\ntrajectories in the phase diagram. It is shown that a population gap in the\nOmega - N plane for accreting compact stars would signal a high density phase\ntransition and could be observed in the distribution of so called Z sources of\nquasi periodic oscillations in low-mass X-ray binaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Aug 2002 21:07:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Here we review and extend the observational evidence for the existence\nof intrinsically magnetized GBHC and show that their existence is consistent\nwith a new class of solutions of the Einstein field equations of General\nRelativity. These solutions are based on a strict adherence to the Principle of\nEquivalence, which prevents the time-like geodesics of physical matter from\nbecoming null on trapped surfaces of infinite red shift. The new solutions\nemerge from the fact that the structure and radiation transfer properties of\nthe energy-momentum tensor on the right hand side of the Einstein field\nequations must have a form that is consistent with this Principle of\nEquivalence requirement. In this context, we show that the Einstein field\nequations allow the existence of highly red shifted, magnetospheric, eternally\ncollapsing objects (MECO) which do not have trapped surfaces which lead to\nevent horizons. Since MECO lifetimes are many orders of magnitude greater than\na Hubble time, they provide an elegant and unified framework for understanding\nthe broad range of observations associated with GBHC and active galactic\nnuclei.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Aug 2002 23:53:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
