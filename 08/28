Using an\nexact time-dependent approach to the interchain/intermolecular charge-transfer\nwithin a long-range interacting model we find that, (i) the relative yield of\nthe singlet exciton in polymers is considerably larger than the 25% predicted\nfrom statistical considerations, (ii) the singlet exciton yield increases with\nchain length in oligomers, and, (iii) in small molecules containing nitrogen\nheteroatoms, the relative yield of the singlet exciton is considerably smaller\nand may be even close to 25%.

The larger (smaller) yield of the\nsinglet (triplet) exciton in carbon-based long-chain polymers is a consequence\nof both its ionic (covalent) nature and smaller (larger) binding energy.

The interaction between the $c\\bar c$ pair and the initial\nhadron is through exchange of soft gluons. The exchange of soft gluons can be\nstudied with heavy quark effective theory and an expansion in the inverse of\ncharm quark mass $m_c$ can be employed. In this approach a simple formula for\nthe S-matrix can be derived by neglecting higher orders in $m_c^{-1}$ and\nrelativistic correction related to charmonia. The S-matrix is related to the\nusual gluon distribution $g(x)$ at small $x$. This result is different than\nthose from other approaches. Confronting experiment the result is not in\nagreement with experimental measurement because large errors from higher order\nin $m_c^{-1}$ and from relativistic corrections.

We introduce the\nconcept of \"proessential point\" and use it to give a new characterization of\npointed Galois topoi. We establish a hierarchy of connected topoi:\n  [1. essentially pointed Atomic = locally simply connected],\n  [2. proessentially pointed Atomic = pointed Galois],\n  [3. pointed Atomic].\n  These topoi are the classifying topos of, respectively: 1. discrete groups,\n2. prodiscrete localic groups, and 3. general localic groups.\n  We analyze also the unpoited version, and show that for a Galois topos, may\nbe pointless, the corresponding groupoid can also be considered, in a sense,\nthe groupoid of \"points\". In the unpointed theories, these topoi classify,\nrespectively: 1. connected discrete groupoids, 2. connected (may be pointless)\nprodiscrete localic groupoids, and 3. connected groupoids with discrete space\nof objects and general localic spaces of hom-sets, when the topos has points\n(we do not know the class of localic groupoids that correspond to pointless\nconnected atomic topoi).\n  We comment and develop on Grothendieck's galois theory and its generalization\nby Joyal-Tierney, and work by other authors on these theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Aug 2002 15:41:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Sep 2002 16:07:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 7 May 2003 18:35:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
