For all sample clusters, both\nthe slope of the luminosity function in the cluster centres and the degree of\nmass segregation are similar to each other, within observational errors of a\nfew tenths of power-law slope fits to the data.

We analyze in some detail the observational\nimplications of such a plerionic environment on the afterglow (AG) and prompt\nGRB emissions, and the prospect for direct detection of the plerion emission.\nWe find that for a simple spherical model, GRBs with iron lines detected in the\nX-ray AG should not have a detectable radio afterglow, and should have small\njet break times and non-relativistic transition times, in disagreement with\nobservations for some of the GRBs with X-ray lines.

The surface pattern or template is decomposed into its Fourier modes,\nand the decay of these modes is analyzed. The persistence of the surface\npattern into the disordered bulk is given for several types of patterns (e.g.\nuniform and striped surface). It further is shown that complex morphology can\nbe induced in a thin film even though the bulk is disordered.

While there are many soft constraint solving formalisms, even\ndistributed ones, by now there seems to be no concurrent programming framework\nwhere soft constraints can be handled. In this paper we show how the classical\nconcurrent constraint (cc) programming framework can work with soft\nconstraints, and we also propose an extension of cc languages which can use\nsoft constraints to prune and direct the search for a solution. We believe that\nthis new programming paradigm, called soft cc (scc), can be also very useful in\nmany web-related scenarios. In fact, the language level allows web agents to\nexpress their interaction and negotiation protocols, and also to post their\nrequests in terms of preferences, and the underlying soft constraint solver can\nfind an agreement among the agents even if their requests are incompatible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2002 19:08:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-27"}

This\npaper demonstrates that the cogen approach is also applicable to the\nspecialisation of logic programs (also called partial deduction) and leads to\neffective specialisers. Moreover, using good binding-time annotations, the\nspeed-ups of the specialised programs are comparable to the speed-ups obtained\nwith online specialisers. The paper first develops a generic approach to\noffline partial deduction and then a specific offline partial deduction method,\nleading to the offline system LIX for pure logic programs. While this is a\nusable specialiser by itself, it is used to develop the cogen system LOGEN.\nGiven a program, a specification of what inputs will be static, and an\nannotation specifying which calls should be unfolded, LOGEN generates a\nspecialised specialiser for the program at hand. Running this specialiser with\nparticular values for the static inputs results in the specialised program.\nWhile this requires two steps instead of one, the efficiency of the\nspecialisation process is improved in situations where the same program is\nspecialised multiple times. The paper also presents and evaluates an automatic\nbinding-time analysis that is able to derive the annotations. While the derived\nannotations are still suboptimal compared to hand-crafted ones, they enable\nnon-expert users to use the LOGEN system in a fully automated way. Finally,\nLOGEN is extended so as to directly support a large part of Prolog's\ndeclarative and non-declarative features and so as to be able to perform so\ncalled mixline specialisations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2002 11:14:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

When the mirror travels under uniform\nacceleration, one encounters severe problems which are due to the infinite blue\nshift effects associated with the horizons. On one hand, the Bogoliubov\ncoefficients are ill-defined and the total energy emitted diverges. On the\nother hand, the instantaneous mean flux vanishes. To obtained well-defined\nexpressions we introduce an alternative model based on an action principle. The\nusefulness of this model is to allow to switch on and off the interaction at\nasymptotically large times. By an appropriate choice of the switching function,\nwe obtain analytical expressions for the scattering amplitudes and the fluxes\nemitted by the mirror. When the coupling is constant, we recover the vanishing\nflux. However it is now followed by transients which inevitably become singular\nwhen the switching off is performed at late time. Our analysis reveals that the\nscattering amplitudes (and the Bogoliubov coefficients) should be seen as\ndistributions and not as mere functions. Moreover, our regularized amplitudes\ncan be put in a one to one correspondence with the transition amplitudes of an\naccelerated detector, thereby unifying the physics of uniformly accelerated\nsystems. In a forthcoming article, we shall use our scattering amplitudes to\nanalyze the quantum correlations amongst emitted particles which are also\nill-defined in the Davies-Fulling model in the presence of horizons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2002 14:13:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
