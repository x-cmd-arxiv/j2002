Because the probability of\ncreating large 3-blocks in these dimensions is very small, we use a ``go with\nthe winners'' method of statistical enhancement to simulate configurations\nhaving probability as small as $10^{-30}$. In earlier work, the fractal\ndimensions of 3-blocks, $d_3$, in 2d and 3d were found to be $1.20\\pm 0.1$ and\n$1.15\\pm 0.1$, respectively, consistent with the possibility that the fractal\ndimension might be the same in all dimensions. We find that the fractal\ndimension of 3-blocks decreases rapidly in higher dimensions, and estimate\n$d_3=0.7\\pm 0.2$ (4d) and $0.5\\pm 0.2$ (5d). At the upper critical dimension of\npercolation, $d_c=6$, our simulations are consistent with $d_3=0$ with\nlogarithmic corrections to power-law scaling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2002 14:32:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

For chaotic\nsystems, two main decay regimes of either Gaussian or exponential behavior have\nbeen identified depending on the strength of the perturbation.

The high efficiency of the MC, that is\nsmall maximum weight or variance of the MC weight is achieved by means of\ndividing the integration domain into small cells. The cells can be\n$n$-dimensional simplices, hyperrectangles or a Cartesian product of them. The\ngrid of cells, ``foam'', is produced in the process of the binary split of the\ncells. The next cell to be divided and the position/direction of the division\nhyperplane is chosen by the algorithm which optimizes the ratio of the maximum\nweight to the average weight or (optionally) the total variance. The algorithm\nis able to deal, in principle, with an arbitrary pattern of the singularities\nin the distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Oct 2002 23:48:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The model consists of two levels (folded and\nunfolded states) separated by an intermediate barrier. We compute the\nprobability distribution for the dissipated work and give analytical\nexpressions for the average and variance of the distribution. To first order,\nthe amount of dissipated work is directly proportional to the rate of\napplication of force (the loading rate), and to the relaxation time of the\nmolecule. The model yields estimates for parameters that characterize the\nunfolding kinetics under force in agreement with those obtained in recent\nexperimental results (Liphardt, J., et al.

We obtain a general equation for the minimum number of repeated\nexperiments needed to obtain an equilibrium free energy, to within $k_BT$, from\nnon-equilibrium experiments using the Jarzynski formula.
