Both V877 Ara and KK\nTel are confirmed to belong to long-period SU UMa-type dwarf novae. In V877\nAra, we found a large decrease of the superhump period (dot(P)/P = -14.5 +/-\n2.1 x 10^(-5)). There is evidence that the period of KK Tel decreased at a\nsimilar or a more exceptional rate. Coupled with the past studies of superhump\nperiod changes, these findings suggest that a previously neglected diversity of\nphenomena is present in long-period SU UMa-type dwarf novae. The present\ndiscovery of a diversity in long-period SU UMa-type systems would become an\nadditional step toward a full understanding the dwarf nova phenomenon. PU CMa\nis shown to be an excellent candidate for an SU UMa-type dwarf nova. We\nexamined the outburst properties of these dwarf novae, and derived\ncharacteristic outburst recurrence times. Combined with the recently published\nmeasurement of the orbital period of PU CMa, we propose that PU CMa is the\nfirst object filling the gap between the extreme WZ Sge-type and ER UMa-type\nstars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Oct 2002 03:43:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

In five of these clusters a\nsignificant soft excess is evident. This soft X-ray excess is compared with the\nthermal emission from both the hot intracluster gas and any cooling (flow) gas\nthat may be present. A warm (kT=0.2 keV), extended (several Mpc), plasma\ncomponent is particularly clear in the outer parts of the cluster, where the\nnormal cluster X-ray emission is weak. This warm component causes both a\nthermal soft X-ray excess at low energies (below 0.4-0.5 keV), as well as O VII\nline emission with a redshift consistent with a cluster origin, and not easily\ninterpreted as Galactic foreground emission. The intensity of this component is\ncommensurate with what has been measured before with the ROSAT PSPC in the 1/4\nkeV band. We attribute this component to emission from intercluster filaments\nof the Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium in the vicinity of these clusters.

We have estimated the\nfollowing average values for the column densities ratios: CN/HCN~2.6,\nHCO+/HCN~0.5, and HNC/HCN~0.4. Thus, the chemical composition of the molecular\nenvelopes in these compact PNe appears somewhat intermediate between the\ncomposition of proto-PNe (such as CRL 2688 or CRL 618) and well evolved PNe\n(such as the Ring, M4--9, or the Helix).

Close to the\ntransition temperature $T_{c}$ fluctuations dominate and the correlation length\n$\\xi $ increases strongly when $T_{c}$ is approached. However, for nonzero\nmagnetic field $H$ there is another length scale $L_{H}=\\sqrt{\\Phi_{0}/aH}$\nwhere $a$ is a universal amplitude. It is comparable to the average distance\nbetween vortex lines. We show that the correlation length is bounded by this\nlength scale, so that $\\xi $ cannot grow beyond $L_{H}$. This implies that type\nII superconductors in a magnetic field do not undergo a phase transition to a\nstate with zero resistance. We sketch the scaling theory of the resulting\nmagnetic field induced finite size effect. In contrast to its inhomogeneity\ninduced counterpart, the magnetic length scale can be varied continuously in\nterms of the magnetic field strength. This opens the possibility to assess the\nimportance of fluctuations, to extract critical point properties of the\nhomogeneous system and to derive a lower bound for the length scale of\ninhomogeneities which affect thermodynamic properties. Our analysis of specific\nheat data for under- and optimally doped YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{7-\\delta}$,\nMgB$_{2}$, 2H-NbSe$_{2}$ and Nb$_{77} $Zr$_{23}$ confirms this expectation.

Intuitively, the two major\nprogramming models, threads and processes, can be considered as extremes along\na sharing axis. Multiple threads through a process share all global state,\nwhereas instances of a process (or independent processes) share no global\nstate. Weaves provide the generalized framework that allows arbitrary\n(selective) sharing of state between multiple control flows through a process.\nThe Weaves framework supports multiple independent components in a single\nprocess, with flexible state sharing and scheduling, all of which is achieved\nwithout requiring any modification to existing code bases. Furthermore, the\nframework allows dynamic instantiation of code modules and control flows\nthrough them. In effect, weaves create intra-process modules (similar to\nobjects in OOP) from code written in any language. The Weaves paradigm allows\nobjects to be arbitrarily shared, it is a true superset of both processes as\nwell as threads, with code sharing and fast context switching time similar to\nthreads. Weaves does not require any special support from either the language\nor application code, practically any code can be weaved. Weaves also include\nsupport for fast automatic checkpointing and recovery with no application\nsupport. This paper presents the elements of the Weaves framework and results\nfrom our implementation that works by reverse-analyzing source-code independent\nELF object files.

Specifically, a set of linear constraints C on K\nvariables is fixed. From a pool of n variables, K variables are chosen\nuniformly at random and a constraint is chosen from C also uniformly at random.\nThis procedure is repeated m times independently. We ask the following\nquestion: is the resulting linear programming problem feasible? We show that\nthe feasibility property experiences a linear phase transition, when n diverges\nto infinity and m=cn for some constant c. Namely, there exists a critical value\nc* such that, when c<c*, the system is feasible or is asymptotically almost\nfeasible, as n increases, but, when c>c*, the \"distance\" from feasibility is at\nleast a positive constant independent of n. Our results are obtained using\npowerful local weak convergence methods developed by Aldous and Steele.\n  By exploiting a linear programming duality, our theorem implies the following\nresult in the context of sparse random graphs G(n, cn) on n nodes with cn\nedges, where edges are equipped with randomly generated weights.

The other\ncalculated results, for relatively higher energies, are also generally\nsatisfactory, particularly for large $\\Theta_{ab}$ geometries. In view of the\npresent results, together with the fact that it is capable of describing\nunequal-energy-sharing kinematics [35], it may be said that the hyperspherical\npartial wave theory is quite appropriate for the description of ionization\nevents of electron-hydrogen type systems. It is also clear that the present\napproach in the implementation of the hyperspherical partial wave theory is\nvery appropriate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Oct 2002 18:25:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Oct 2002 03:13:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 24 Dec 2002 05:26:57 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 2003 17:41:41 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 24 Jan 2003 05:59:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We assume that the FlcVcm is consistent by neutral dynamides, which\nare streamlined in a close-packed crystalline lattice. Every dynamide is a\nneutral pair, consistent by massless opposite point-like elementary electric\ncharges (ElmElcChrgs): electrino (-) and positrino (+). In an equilibrium\nposition two contrary Pnt-Lk ElmElcChrgs within every one dynamide are very\nclosely installed one to another and therefore its aggregate polarization and\nits ElcFld also have zero values. However the absence of a mass in a rest of an\nelectrino and positrino makes possible they to display an infinitesimal\ninertness of their own QntElcMgnFlds and a big mobility, what permits them to\nbe found a bigger time in an unequilibrium distorted position. The aggregate\nElcFld of dynamide reminds us that it could be considered as the QntElcFld of\nan electric quasi-dipole because both massless electrino and positrino have the\nsame inertness. The aggregate ElcFld of every dynamide polarizes nearest\nneighbour dynamides in an account of which they interact between them-self, on\naccount of which their photons display a wave character and behaviour.
