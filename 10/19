As the ring diffuses in radius by virtue of its intrinsic\nviscosity, the two planets are wedged further apart.

At the same time,\nthe crossing cannot be of such long duration that the disk's direct influence\non the bodies' eccentricities interferes with the resonant interaction between\nthe two planets.

The radio emission correlates very tightly with\nthe X-rays over more than two orders of magnitude in X-ray flux density,\nsuggesting that the jet plasma also plays a role at higher frequencies. We\ncompare the predictions of our jet model, with and without acceleration, to\nthirteen broadband simultaneous or quasi-simultaneous spectra over this\nchanging flux history. In addition, we consider a simple standard thin disk\nwhich transitions to an optically thin accretion flow, in order to account for\nthe assumedly thermal optical data seen in some observations. A solution\nwithout acceleration cannot describe the data without unrealistic energy\nrequirements. But because of the low disk luminosity, and possibly the assumed\ndisk geometry, acceleration in the jet is limited only by synchrotron cooling\nand can extend easily into the X-rays. We present a model which can account for\nall the broadband spectra included here, by changing only two parameters in the\njet model: the input power and the location of the first acceleration zone.\nHowever, the model is most sensitive to changes in the jet power, the varying\nof which can also account for the slope of the observed radio/X-ray correlation\nanalytically.

We discuss how causality requirements can be\nconsistently implemented in this framework, and construct causal transiton\namplitudes between quantum gravity states, i.e. realising in the spin foam\ncontext the Feynman propagator between states. The resulting causal spin foam\nmodel can be seen as a path integral quantization of Lorentzian first order\nRegge calculus, and represents a link between several approaches to quantum\ngravity as canonical loop quantum gravity, sum-over-histories formulations,\ndynamical triangulations and causal sets. In particular, we show how the\nresulting model can be rephrased within the framework of quantum causal sets\n(or histories).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Oct 2002 21:45:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Dec 2002 09:48:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 6 Feb 2003 16:16:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-05"}
