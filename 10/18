Here\nwe report ten years of high resolution astrometric imaging that allow us to\ntrace two thirds of the orbit of the star currently closest to the compact\nradio source and massive black hole candidate SgrA*. In particular, we have\nobserved both peri- and apocentre passages. Our observations show that the star\nis on a bound, highly elliptical Keplerian orbit around SgrA*, with an orbital\nperiod of 15.2 years and a peri-centre distance of only 17 light hours. The\norbital elements require an enclosed point mass of 3.7+-1.5x10^6 solar masses.\nThe data exclude with high confidence that the central dark mass consists of a\ncluster of astrophysical objects or massive, degenerate fermions, and strongly\nconstrain the central density structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Oct 2002 15:19:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Amdahl's law and the Multiprocessing Factor (MPF) are two\nscaling models used in industry and academia for estimating multiprocessor\ncapacity in the presence of this multiprocessor effect. Both models express\ndifferent laws of diminishing returns. Amdahl's law identifies diminishing\nprocessor capacity with a fixed degree of serialization in the workload, while\nthe MPF model treats it as a constant geometric ratio. The utility of both\nmodels for performance evaluation stems from the presence of a single parameter\nthat can be determined easily from a small set of benchmark measurements. This\nutility, however, is marred by a dilemma. The two models produce different\nresults, especially for large processor configurations that are so important\nfor today's applications. The question naturally arises: Which of these two\nmodels is the correct one to use? Ignoring this question merely reduces\ncapacity prediction to arbitrary curve-fitting. Removing the dilemma requires a\ndynamical interpretation of these scaling models. We present a physical\ninterpretation based on queueing theory and show that Amdahl's law corresponds\nto synchronous queueing in a bus model while the MPF model belongs to a Coxian\nserver model.
