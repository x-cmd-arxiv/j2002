Our original motivation\nfor this study was to search for systematic differences between BLRGs and their\nradio-quiet counterparts, the Seyfert galaxies, whose temporal and spectral\nbehavior is better studied. We find that both 3C 390.3 and 3C 120 are highly\nvariable, but in a different way, and quantify this difference by means of a\nstructure function analysis. 3C 390.3 is significantly more variable than 3C\n120, despite its jet larger inclination angle, implying either that the X-ray\nvariability is not dominated by the jet or that two different variability\nprocesses are simultaneously at work in 3C 390.3. We performed an\nenergy-selected and time-resolved analysis based on the fractional variability\namplitude and found that the variability amplitude of both objects is strongly\nanticorrelated with the energy. This last result, along with the correlated\nchange of the photon index with the X-ray continuum flux, can be qualitatively\nexplained within the scenario of thermal Comptonization, generally invoked for\nradio-quiet active galaxies. Moreover, the time-resolved and energy-selected\nfractional variability analyses show a trend opposite to that observed in\njet-dominated AGN (blazars), suggesting only a minor contribution of the jet to\nthe X-ray properties of BLRGs. Time-averaged spectral analysis indicates the\npresence of a strong, resolved iron line with centroid at 6.4 keV and a weak\nreflection component in both objects. The overall PCA+HEXTE spectra are best\nfitted with the constant density ionization model of Ross & Fabian, but with a\nmodest ionization parameter(abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Oct 2002 15:35:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
