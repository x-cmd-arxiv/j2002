Raw laser noise is several orders of\nmagnitude above the other noises and thus it is essential to bring it down to\nthe level of shot, acceleration noises. A rigorous and systematic formalism\nusing the techniques of computational commutative algebra was developed which\ngenerates all the data combinations cancelling the laser frequency noise. The\nrelevant data combinations form a first module of syzygies. In this paper we\nuse this formalism for optimisation of the LISA sensitivity by analysing the\nnoise and signal covariance matrices. The signal covariance matrix, averaged\nover polarisations and directions, is calculated for binaries whose frequency\nchanges at most adiabatically. We then present the extremal SNR curves for all\nthe data combinations in the module. They correspond to the eigenvectors of the\nnoise and signal covariance matrices. We construct LISA `network' SNR by\ncombining the outputs of the eigenvectors which improves the LISA sensitivity\nsubstantially. The maximum SNR curve can yield an improvement upto 70 % over\nthe Michelson, mainly at high frequencies, while the improvement using the\nnetwork SNR ranges from 40 % to over 100 %. Finally, we describe a simple toy\nmodel, in which LISA rotates in a plane. In this analysis, we estimate the\nimprovement in the LISA sensitivity, if one switches from one data combination\nto another as it rotates. Here the improvement in sensitivity, if one switches\noptimally over three cyclic data combinations of the eigenvector is about 55 %\non an average over the LISA band-width.

Sally defined the core of an $R$-ideal $I$ as the intersection\nof all $($minimal$)$ reductions of $I$. However, it is not easy to give an\nexplicit characterization of it in terms of data attached to the ideal. Until\nrecently, the only case in which a closed formula was known is the one of\nintegrally closed ideals in a two-dimensional regular local ring, due to C.\nHuneke and I. Swanson. The main result of this paper explicitly describes the\ncore of a broad class of ideals with good residual properties in an arbitrary\nlocal Cohen-Macaulay ring. We also find sharp bounds on the number of minimal\nreductions that one needs to intersect to get the core.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Oct 2002 21:21:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
