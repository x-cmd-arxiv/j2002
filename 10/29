We find that rotation induces the cooling of the\naccreting star so that the delivered gravitational energy causes a greater\nexpansion with respect to the standard non-rotating case. The increase in the\nsurface radius produces a decrease in the surface value of the critical angular\nvelocity and, therefore, the accreting WD becomes gravitationally unbound\n(Roche instability). This occurrence is due to an increase in the total angular\nmomentum of the accreting WD and depends critically on the amount of specific\nangular momentum deposited by the accreted matter. If the specific angular\nmomentum of the accreted matter is equal to that of the outer layers of the\naccreting structure, the Roche instability occurs well before the accreting WD\ncan attain the physical conditions for C-burning. If the values of both initial\nangular velocity and accretion rate are small, we find that the accreting WD\nundergoes a secular instability when its total mass approaches 1.4 Msun. At\nthis stage, the ratio between the rotational and the gravitational binding\nenergy of the WD becomes of the order of 0.1, so that the star must deform by\nadopting an elliptical shape. In this case, since the angular velocity of the\nWD is as large as 1 rad/s, the anisotropic mass distribution induces the loss\nof rotational energy and angular momentum via GWR. We find that, independent of\nthe braking efficiency, the WD contracts and achieves the physical conditions\nsuitable for explosive C-burning at the center so that a type Ia supernova\nevent is produced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2002 11:31:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

It had been amply demonstrated that these model\nequations reproduce the phenomenon, but the results of DNS were not analyzed so\nfar with the goal of interpreting the phenomenon. In order to construct a\nuseful framework for the understanding of drag reduction we initiate in this\npaper an investigation of the most important modes that are sustained in the\nviscoelastic and Newtonian turbulent flows respectively. The modes are obtained\nempirically using the Karhunen-Loeve decomposition, allowing us to compare the\nmost energetic modes in the viscoelastic and Newtonian flows. The main finding\nof the present study is that the spatial profile of the most energetic modes is\nhardly changed between the two flows. What changes is the energy associated\nwith these modes, and their relative ordering in the decreasing order from the\nmost energetic to the least. Modes that are highly excited in one flow can be\nstrongly suppressed in the other, and vice versa. This dramatic energy\nredistribution is an important clue to the mechanism of drag reduction as is\nproposed in this paper. In particular there is an enhancement of the energy\ncontaining modes in the viscoelastic flow compared to the Newtonian one; drag\nreduction is seen in the energy containing modes rather than the dissipative\nmodes as proposed in some previous theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2002 15:21:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In order to construct the\nequation so that it may accommodate physical states the concept of Spin Frames\nis introduced, and it is found that such an equation may propagate physical\nfields whose spin states differ by two units of angular momentum namely $\\Delta\nJ=2$. The solution for the free field case is given by boosting a rest frame\nspinor with the infinite dimensional Lorentz Boost which are constructed as\nwell.

We\nalso make a preliminary study of the effect of noise on information transfer\ntime, and find that noise tends to increase transfer times. Noise and\ninformation signals are both essentially acausal, such that analytic\ncontinuation (i.e. prediction) is impossible, which also implies that their\nfrequency spectra cannot be holomorphic. This leads to the paradox of a\nnon-holomorphic information-bearing light signal, yet whose underlying Maxwell\nequations governing the propagation of the EM wave describe a holomorphic\nfunction in spacetime. We find that application of stationary phase and entropy\narguments circumvents this difficulty, with stationary phase only suggesting\nthe most likely transfer times of an information signal in the presence of\nnoise. Faster transit times are not excluded, but are highly improbable.\nStationary phase solutions, by definition, do not include signal forerunners,\nwhose detection in the presence of noise is also unreliable. Hence a finite\ninformation capacity ensues, as expected from Shannon's law, and information\ncannot be transferred faster than c. We also find that the method of stationary\nphase implies complex transfer times. However, by considering spacetime to be\nisomorphic with the complex temporal plane, we find that an imaginary time is\nequivalent to a real distance, and can be interpreted as the uncertainty in the\nspatial position of the information pulse. Finally, we apply our theory to a\nphotonic band gap crystal, and find that information transfer speed and\ntunneling is always subluminal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2002 18:51:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
