On a quasi-isentropic aproximation in which the\ndynamic force is approximately the same as the static force, k is not a\nconstant. Only by considering an ideal spring where k is constant and only on a\nstatic regime, can we say the energy is 1/2 k xx. For any dynamic regime of\nsuch an ideal spring, the energy of the spring is a function of its temperature\nand therefore is different from 1/2 k xx. If any given mass is moving attached\nto an ideal spring, the movement will eventually cease even if such movement\noccurs in vacuum. The dynamic force is not the static force kx.

The modest ability of 'tuning' the transition energies of\nindividual qubits proves to be sufficient, with a suitable encoding of the\nlogical qubits, to generate universal quantum gates. Furthermore, by tuning the\nqubits collectively we provide a scheme with exceptional experimental\nsimplicity: computations are controlled via a single 'switch' of only six\nsettings.
