From the Ha\nluminosity, we estimate star formation rates (SFRs) which are 7 to 15 times\nhigher than those inferred from the UV continuum flux at 1500 ang without dust\nextinction correction. The behavior of S2 and A2 in terms of O/H and N/O\nabundance ratios are very different, and they are also different from typical\nLBGs at z ~ 3. S2 is a low-metallicity object (Z ~ 0.03 Zsun) with a low N/O\nratio, similar to those derived in the most metal-poor nearby HII galaxies. In\ncontrast, A2 is a high-metallicity galaxy (Z ~ 1.3 Zsun) with a high N/O\nabundance ratio, similar to those derived in the most metal-rich starburst\nnucleus galaxies. The virial masses, derived from emission-line widths, are 0.5\nand 2.4 x 10^10 Msun, for S2 and A2 respectively. Thanks to the gravitational\namplification, the line profiles of S2 are spatially resolved, leading to a\nvelocity gradient of +- 240 km/s, which yields a dynamical mass of ~ 1.3 x\n10^10 Msun within the inner 1 kpc radius. Combining these new data with the\nsample of LBGs at z ~ 3, we conclude that these three galaxies exhibit\ndifferent physical properties in terms of SFRs, abundance and mass-to-light\nratios, and reddening. High-redshift galaxies of different luminosities could\nthus have quite different star formation histories (abridged version).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2002 16:19:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Kepler is a NASA-approved mission whose goal is\nto detect a large number of extrasolar, earth-like planets by obtaining\nnear-continuous photometry of > 100,000 F, G, and K dwarfs for four years. The\nexpected photometric precision of Kepler is 90 micromag (achieved in 15 minute\nsamples), at which the effect of microlensing by a transiting companion can be\nsignificant. For example, for a solar-type primary transited by a white-dwarf\nsecondary, the maximum depth of the transit is 0.01%, which is almost entirely\ncompensated by the microlensing amplification when the white dwarf is at ~0.05\nAU. The combined effect of microlensing and transit increases to a net\namplification of 150 micromag at an orbital separation of 0.1 AU, and 2.4\nmillimag at an orbital separation of 1 AU. Thus, the effect of microlensing can\nbe used to break the degeneracy between a planetary-mass object for which the\nmicrolensing effect is negligible, and a more massive object of the same size.\nFor brown dwarfs at orbital separations of a few AU, the effect of microlensing\nis several percent of the transit depth, and hence the microlensing effect must\nbe taken into account in deriving the physical parameters of the brown dwarf.\nThe microlensing signal caused by a neutron star or a black hole in a binary\ncan be several millimag, far exceeding the transit depth, and potentially\ndetectable even from ground-based observations.

We have considered two galactic\ndark compact objects distributions, with total optical depths corresponding to\nthe EROS current upper limits. These models correspond to two extreme\nhypothesis on a three component galactic structure made of a thin disc, a thick\ndisc, and a spherically symmetric halo. Our study shows that for sub-solar mass\nlenses, an exposure of $8\\times 10^7$ star$\\times$yr toward LMC should allow to\ndistinguish between these two extreme models. In addition the self-lensing\nhypothesis (lensing by LMC objects) can efficiently be tested through the\nmethod proposed here.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Oct 2002 13:44:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Aug 2003 13:34:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In addition, the insulating M2 phase is investigated for the first\ntime. The density functional calculations allow for a consistent understanding\nof all three phases. In the rutile phase metallic conductivity is carried by\nmetal t_2g orbitals, which fall into the one-dimensional d_parallel band, and\nthe isotropically dispersing e_g^pi bands. Hybridization of both types of bands\nis weak. In the M1 phase splitting of the d_parallel band due to metal-metal\ndimerization and upshift of the e_g^pi bands due to increased p-d overlap lead\nto an effective separation of both types of bands. Despite incomplete opening\nof the optical band gap due to the shortcomings of the local density\napproximation, the metal-insulator transition can be understood as a\nPeierls-like instability of the d_parallel band in an embedding background of\ne_g^pi electrons.

Using a\ngeneralization of the Imry-Ma argument, we find that the first order transition\nis rounded by disorder at or below the lower critical dimension d_c=3, when at\nleast one of the two phases has no screening ability. The increase of d_c from\n2 (as in the random field Ising model) to 3 is due to the long-range nature of\nthe Coulomb interaction. This result suggests that large clusters of both\nphases will appear near such transitions due to disorder, in both two and three\ndimensions. Possible implications of our results on manganites and underdoped\ncuprates will be discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Oct 2002 13:48:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Feb 2003 21:11:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2003 19:39:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Models with universal soft breaking (mSUGRA) and non-universal\ngaugino or Higgs masses at M_G are examined. For mSUGRA, the m_h, b->s gamma\nand Omega h^2 constraints imply a lower bound on the gaugino mass of\nm_{1/2}>~300GeV implying the gluino and squarks have mass >~700GeV, and the\nneutralino >~120GeV. The current status of the Brookhaven muon g - 2 experiment\nis reviewed, and if the Standard Model (SM) contribution evaluated using the\ne^+ + e^- data is correct, a 2 sigma bound on the deviation of experiment from\nthe SM produces an upper bound on m_{1/2} that eliminates the \"focus point\"\nregions of parameter space.

In this paper, we generalize Madelung's\ntransformation to the quaternionic Schroedinger equation. The non-abelian\nnature of the full SU(2) gauge group of this equation leads to a richer, more\nintricate set of fluid equations than those arising from complex quantum\nmechanics. We begin by describing the quaternionic version of Madelung's\ntransformation, and identifying its ``hydrodynamic'' variables. In order to\nfind Hamiltonian equations of motion for these, we first develop the canonical\nPoisson bracket and Hamiltonian for the quaternionic Schroedinger equation, and\nthen apply Madelung's transformation to derive non-canonical Poisson brackets\nyielding the desired equations of motion. These are a particularly natural set\nof equations for a non-abelian fluid, and differ from those obtained by\nBistrovic et al. only by a global gauge transformation. Because we have\nobtained these equations by a transformation of the quaternionic Schroedinger\nequation, and because many techniques for simulating complex quantum mechanics\ngeneralize straightforwardly to the quaternionic case, our observation leads to\nsimple algorithms for the computer simulation of non-abelian fluids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Oct 2002 03:49:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

We report here measurements at densities up to N?7\nnm$^{-3}$, close to the critical density, $N_c \\approx$ 8.1 nm$^{-3}$, reached\nfor the isotherm closest to the critical one. At all temperatures, below as\nwell as above Tc, and up to moderately high densities, the density-normalized\nmobility $\\mu N$ shows the usual electric field dependence present in a gas\nwith a Ramsauer-Townsend minimum due to the mainly attractive electron-atom\ninteraction. mN is constant and field independent for small values of $E,$\nshows a maximum for a reduced field $E/N \\approx$ 4 mTd, and then decreases\nrapidly with the field, approximately proportional to $(E/N)^{-1/2}.$ The\nzero-field density-normalized mobility $\\mu_0 N, $for all T>$T_c,$ shows the\nwell known anomalous positive density effect, i.e., m0N increases with\nincreasing N, confirming previous results obtained for T=300 K and 162.7 K.\nBelow Tc, however, $\\mu_0 N$ does not show the expected anomalous positive\ndensity effect, but it rather features a broad maximum.

In any case, the\ndata at all temperatures confirm the interpretation of the anomalous density\neffect as being essentially due by the density-dependent quantum shift of the\nelectron ground state kinetic energy in a disordered medium as a result of\nmultiple scattering (MS) processes, although other MS processes do influence\nthe outcome of the experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Oct 2002 15:51:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
