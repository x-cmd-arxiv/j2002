To this end we conducted two distinct tests\nbased on optical and near-infrared single-star photometry. The optical and the\nnear-infrared experiments complement one another; the optical data help us to\nrule out distant populations but they are restricted to the central regions of\nthe gas distributions, whereas the near-infrared photometry allows us to set\nlimits on nearby populations spread over the typical cloud size. First, we\ndiscuss deep optical single-star photometry of five CHVCs in the V and I\nfilters, obtained with the FORS instrument at the Very Large Telecope (VLT). We\nfind that their optical colour-magnitude diagrams are indistinguishable from\nthat of a population of Galactic stars, and attribute all of the resolved stars\nto Galactic foreground. We present simulations which address the question of\nhow much of a \"normal\" dwarf-galaxy type population we might hide in the data.\nA Kolmogorov-Smirnov test allows us to set very stringent limits on the absence\nof a resolved stellar population in CHVCs. Second, we also culled near infrared\nsingle-star photometry in the J, H, and K_S bands for four of the CHVCs from\nthe Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS). The infrared data do not reveal any\nstellar contents in the CHVCs which resembles that of nearby dwarf galaxies\neither, and are explained with Galactic foreground as well. We interpret our\nnull detections to indicate that the five CHVCs investigated by us do not host\nan associated stellar content which is similar to that of the known dwarf\ngalaxies of the Local Group. These CHVCs are very likely pure hydrogen clouds\nin which no star formation has taken place over cosmic time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Oct 2002 17:31:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-23"}

Numerous observations throughout\nastronomy cannot be explained if we neglect their influence, yet our\nquantitative understanding of the ways in which supernovae affect the universe\nremains remarkably poor. This is one of the most embarrassing gaps in our\nknowledge of the cosmos, and planned telescopes and surveys will probably not\ndo much to fill it. The problem is that these surveys will be optimized to\nobserve galaxies and intergalactic material independently of each other, while\n(in the author's view) by far the best information will come from simultaneous\nsurveys of galaxies and the intergalactic material (IGM) in their vicinity.\nOnly this will show directly how galaxies affect their surroundings and provide\na rough energy scale for supernova-driven winds. Redshifts 1<z<3 are ideal for\nthe joint galaxy/IGM surveys we advocate, because the comoving density of star\nformation is near its peak, because the Lyman-alpha forest is thin enough for\nQSO spectra to reveal the locations of the dominant metallic species, and\nbecause bright background QSOs are common.

The\n$\\beta$ relaxation at short times is explained in terms of the Krall-Weitz\nmodel for the decorelation due to the elastic modes present. The $\\alpha$\nrelaxation at long times is well described by a stretched exponential, showing\na wide spectrum of relaxation times for which the $q$ dependence is\n$\\tau_{\\alpha} = q^{-2.2}$, lower than for diffusion.

This is detected\nby calculations of Seiberg-Witten invariants. The surgery in question can be\nperformed on any 4-manifold which contains as a codimension 0 submanifold a\npunctured surface bundle over a punctured surface and a nontrivial loop in the\nbase which has trivial monodromy.\n  A starting point for another class of examples in this paper is a family of\nexamples which show that the Parshin-Arakelov theorem for holomorphic Lefschetz\nfibrations is false in the symplectic category.
