Neither of these\nphenomena have previously been seen in the light curve of a nova in outburst.\nThe ``burst'' was a factor of 10 rise in X-ray counts near the middle of the\nsecond observation, and which lasted about 1000 sec; it exhibited at least two\npeaks, in addition to other structure. Our time series analysis of the combined\n25 ksec observation shows a peak at 2500 s which is present in independent\nanalyses of both the zeroth order image and the dispersed spectrum and is not\npresent in similar analyses of grating data for HZ 43 and Sirius B.

We point out that all such\ndetection methods are equivalent to passing the signal through a filter bank\nand linearly combine the output energy. Existing methods for the choice of the\nfilter bank and of the weight parameters rely essentially on the two following\nideas: (i) the use of the likelihood function based on a (possibly\nnon-informative) statistical model of the signal and the noise, (ii) the use of\nMonte-Carlo simulations for the tuning of parametric filters to get the best\ndetection probability keeping fixed the false alarm rate. We propose a third\napproach according to which the filter bank is \"learned\" from a set of training\ndata. By-products of this viewpoint are that, contrarily to previous methods,\n(i) there is no requirement of an explicit description of the probability\ndensity function of the data when the signal is present and (ii) the filters we\nuse are non-parametric. The learning procedure may be described as a two step\nprocess: first, estimate the mean and covariance of the signal with the\ntraining data; second, find the filters which maximize a contrast criterion\nreferred to as deflection between the \"noise only\" and \"signal+noise\"\nhypothesis. The deflection is homogeneous to the signal-to-noise ratio and it\nuses the quantities estimated at the first step. We apply this original method\nto the problem of the detection of supernovae core collapses. We use the\ncatalog of waveforms provided recently by Dimmelmeier et al. to train our\nalgorithm.

Employing functional\ntechniques of field theory, the degrees of freedom of the radiation field are\neliminated to obtain the influence phase functional which describes the reduced\ndynamics of the matter variables. The general theory is applied to the dynamics\nof a single electron in the radiation field. From a study of the wave packet\ndynamics a quantitative measure for the degree of decoherence, the decoherence\nfunction, is deduced. The latter is shown to describe the emergence of\ndecoherence through the emission of bremsstrahlung caused by the relative\nmotion of interfering wave packets. It is argued that this mechanism is the\nmost fundamental process in Quantum Electrodynamics leading to the destruction\nof coherence, since it dominates for short times and because it is at work even\nin the electromagnetic field vacuum at zero temperature. It turns out that\ndecoherence trough bremsstrahlung is very small for single electrons but\nextremely large for superpositions of many-particle states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Oct 2002 09:22:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
