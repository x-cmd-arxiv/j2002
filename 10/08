We find\nthat the predicted redshift distribution and number count of weak lenses are\nhighly degenerate in w and \\Omega_0. If we fix \\Omega_0 the number count for\nw=-2/3 is a factor of 2 smaller than for the \\LambdaCDM model. However, if we\nallow \\Omega_0 to vary with w such that the amplitude of the matter power\nspectrum as measured by COBE matches that obtained from the X-ray cluster\nabundance, the decrease in the predicted lens abundance is less than 25% for -1\n< w < -0.4. We show that a more promising method for constraining the dark\nenergy---one that is largely unaffected by the \\Omega_0 - w degeneracy as well\nas uncertainties in observational noise---is to compare the relative abundance\nof virialized X-ray lensing clusters with the abundance of non-virialized,\nX-ray underluminous, lensing halos. For aperture sizes of 15 arcmin, the\npredicted ratio of the non-virialized to virialized lenses is greater than 40%\nand varies by 20% between w=-1 and w=-0.6.

These\nimply the existence of a dark and compact mass component near the center of\nM15, either a single black hole (BH) or a collection of dark remnants that have\nsunk to the cluster center due to mass segregation. We previously showed that\nthe latter interpretation is in conflict with the D97 M/L profile, which\nsupported the BH interpretation. We repeat our analysis here with the corrected\nD97 profile. Models without a BH are now found to be statistically acceptable\n(within 1-sigma), although inclusion of a BH still provides a marginally better\nfit. It does not necessarily follow that dark remnants are now the preferred\ninterpretation of the data. The D97 models, as well as N-body models by\nBaumgardt et al. (2002), assume that all neutron stars are retained during\ncluster evolution. This conflicts with predictions of the neutron-star\nretention rate (typically below 10 per cent) based on pulsar kick velocities.\nThe presence of a single BH therefore continues to be a viable interpretation\nof the data. The best fit BH mass with the corrected D97 M/L profile is M_BH =\n1.7^{+2.7}_{-1.7} x 10^3 solar masses, and with a constant M/L it is M_BH =\n3.2^{+2.2}_{-2.2} x 10^3 solar masses. A model that includes both neutron star\nescape and mass segregation would probably yield a value between these numbers.\nThis agrees with the correlation between velocity dispersion and BH mass\ninferred for galaxies. However, with the presently available models and data it\nis neither uniquely implied nor ruled out that M15 has an intermediate-mass BH.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Oct 2002 18:20:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Oct 2002 01:23:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The model possesses a number of profitable features.\nNamely, the analytic invariant charge has no unphysical peculiarities at any\nloop level; it contains no free parameters; it incorporates ultraviolet\nasymptotic freedom with infrared enhancement; it has universal behavior both in\nultraviolet and infrared regions at any loop level; it possesses a good higher\nloop and scheme stability.

An application of Lie\nalgebras (Hamiltonians) for construction of universal gates is revisited first.\nIt is shown next, how for quantum computation with qubits can be used\ntwo-dimensional analog of this Cayley-Weyl matrix algebras, i.e. Clifford\nalgebras, and discussed well known applications to product operator formalism\nin NMR, Jordan-Wigner construction in fermionic quantum computations. It is\nintroduced universal set of quantum gates for higher dimensional system\n(``qudit''), as some generalization of these models. Finally it is briefly\nmentioned possible application of such algebraic methods to design of quantum\nprocessors (programmable gates arrays) and discussed generalization to quantum\ncomputation with continuous variables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2002 13:10:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

They\nare: the notion \"wave-particle\", the probabilistic interpretation of the\nSchroedinger wave \\psi-function and hence the probability amplitude and its\nphase, long-range action, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, etc. The\nprobabilistic formalism is developed in the phase space, but not in the real\none. Elimination of the difficulties is likely if we are able to develop\nquantum mechanics in the real space. Such a theory in fact can be constructed,\nhowever, it should proceed from deepest first principles starting from the\nnotion of a 4D space-time, the notion of a massive particle in the space, the\nprinciples of the motion of a particle, etc. The theory should be characterized\nby short-range action that automatically means the introduction of a quantum\nmechanical force. It is shown that the aforementioned force makes it evident\nand, moreover, is able to appear on the macroscopic scale. A simple experiment,\nthe express test, which in fact proves the macroscopic manifestation of quantum\nmechanical force, is proposed for the demonstration in the quantum curriculum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2002 14:21:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
