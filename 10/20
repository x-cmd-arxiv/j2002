Nuclear\nfusion reactions occur only among few protons and nuclei with higher relative\nenergies than Coulomb barrier. It is the equilibrium velocity distribution of\nthese high-energy protons and nuclei that participates in determining the rate\nof nuclear fusion reactions. In the circumstance it is inappropriate to use the\nMaxwellian velocity distribution for calculating the nuclear fusion reaction\nrate. We use the relativistic equilibrium velocity distribution for this\npurpose. The rate based on the relativistic equilibrium velocity distribution\nhas a reduction factor with respect to that based on the Maxwellian\ndistribution, which factor depends on the temperature, reduced mass and atomic\nnumbers of the studied nuclear fusion reactions.

The structure of this set of ensembles remains to\nbe explored by philosophers.\n  The second is the way the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian approaches' variational\nprinciples state the law of motion by mentioning contralegal dynamical\nevolutions.
