The underlying idea behind most glitch models is that, as\nthe neutron star crust spins down due to the emission of electromagnetic\nradiation, the superfluid component lags behind until a critical point is\nreached and angular momentum is transferred from the superfluid to the crust,\nleading to the spin-up associated with the glitch. In this Letter we describe a\nsuperfluid analogue of the two-stream instability that is well known in plasma\nphysics, and provide evidence that this instability is likely to be relevant\nfor neutron stars. This is a new physical mechanism which may play a key role\nin explaining the glitch mechanism and which could also prove to be relevant in\nlaboratory experiments on superfluid Helium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2002 09:32:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

In this paper we develop a\nmicroscopic dynamical statistical model for the continuous double auction under\nthe assumption of IID random order flow, and analyze it using simulation,\ndimensional analysis, and theoretical tools based on mean field approximations.\nThe model makes testable predictions for basic properties of markets, such as\nprice volatility, the depth of stored supply and demand vs. price, the bid-ask\nspread, the price impact function, and the time and probability of filling\norders. These predictions are based on properties of order flow and the limit\norder book, such as share volume of market and limit orders, cancellations,\ntypical order size, and tick size. Because these quantities can all be measured\ndirectly there are no free parameters. We show that the order size, which can\nbe cast as a nondimensional granularity parameter, is in most cases a more\nsignificant determinant of market behavior than tick size. We also provide an\nexplanation for the observed highly concave nature of the price impact\nfunction. On a broader level, this work suggests how stochastic models based on\nzero-intelligence agents may be useful to probe the structure of market\ninstitutions. Like the model of perfect rationality, a stochastic-zero\nintelligence model can be used to make strong predictions based on a compact\nset of assumptions, even if these assumptions are not fully believable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2002 02:11:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

References added","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"hep-th","license":null,"abstract":"  This thesis is devoted to studying two important aspects of braneworld\nphysics: their cosmology and their holography. We examine the Einstein\nequations induced on a general $(n-2)$-brane of arbitrary tension, embedded in\nsome $n$-dimensional bulk. The brane energy-momentum tensor enters these\nequations both linearly and quadratically. From the point of view of a\nhomogeneous and isotropic brane we see quadratic deviations from the FRW\nequations of the standard cosmology. There is also a contribution from a bulk\nWeyl tensor. We study this in detail when the bulk is AdS-Schwarzschild or\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"om AdS. This contribution can be understood holographically.\nFor the AdS-Schwarzschild case, we show that the geometry on a brane near the\nAdS boundary is just that of a radiation dominated FRW universe. The radiation\ncomes from a field theory that is dual to the AdS bulk. We also develop a new\napproach which allows us to consider branes that are not near the AdS boundary.\nThis time the dual field theory contributes quadratic energy density/pressure\nterms to the FRW equations. Remarkably, these take exactly the same form as for\nadditional matter placed on the brane by hand, with no bulk Weyl tensor.\n  We also derive the general equations of motion for a braneworld containing a\ndomain wall. For the critical brane, the induced geometry is identical to that\nof a vacuum domain wall in $(n-1)$-dimensional Einstein gravity. We develop the\ntools to construct a nested Randall-Sundrum scenario whereby we have a\n``critical'' domain wall living on an anti-de Sitter brane. We also show how to\nconstruct instantons on the brane, and calculate the probability of false\nvacuum decay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2002 15:20:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2002 12:12:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Both phenomena are controlled by\ntunneling across the molecular bridge and are consequently expected to show\nexponential decrease with bridge length that is indeed often observed.\nDeviations from this exponential dependence for long bridges, in particular a\ncrossover to a very weak dependence on bridge length were recently observed\nexperimentally and discussed theoretically in terms of thermal relaxation and\ndephasing on the bridge. Here we discuss two other factors that potentially\naffect the bridge length dependence of these phenomena. First, in experiments\ninitiated by an initial preparation of a non-stationary \"donor\" state the\ninitial energy is not well defined. A small contribution from initially\npopulated eigenstates that are of mostly bridge-level character may dominate\ntransmission for long bridges, resulting in weak or no bridge-length\ndependence. Secondly, in steady state experiments the distribution of initial\nstates (for example the Fermi distribution at the electrodes in conduction\nexperiments) will cause deviations from exponential dependence on wire length\nbecause even a small population in higher energy states will dominate the\ntransmission through long wires. For the first scenario we show that the\ncrossover behavior observed for electron transfer in DNA between G and GGG\nspecies separated by AT chains can be largely reproduced just by initial state\neffects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2002 15:35:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
