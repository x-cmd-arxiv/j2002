In the research on graphically represented statistical models,\nit is known that the belief propagation (BP) can exactly perform the inference\nin a polynomial time scale of the system size when the graph is free from\ncycles in spite that the necessary computation for general graphs exponentially\nexplodes in the worst case. In addition, recent several researches revealed\nthat the BP can also serve as an excellent approximation algorithm even if the\ngraph has cycles as far as they are relatively long.

We consider this indicator of local complexity of the dynamics and\nprovide different examples of its behavior, showing how it can be useful to\ncharacterize various kind of weakly chaotic dynamics. We also provide criteria\nto find systems with non trivial orbit complexity (systems where the\ndescription of the whole orbit requires an infinite amount of information). We\nconsider also a global indicator of the complexity of the system. This global\nindicator generalizes the topological entropy, taking into account systems were\nthe number of essentially different orbits increases less than exponentially.\nThen we prove that if the system is constructive (roughly speaking: if the map\ncan be defined up to any given accuracy using a finite amount of information)\nthe orbit complexity is everywhere less or equal than the generalized\ntopological entropy. Conversely there are compact non constructive examples\nwhere the inequality is reversed, suggesting that this notion comes out\nnaturally in this kind of complexity questions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2002 10:29:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We find solutions to this system in terms of the single coin\nrandom walk, and compare the asymptotic limit of these solutions to numerical\nsimulations. We find exact analytical expressions for the time-dependence of\nthe first two moments, and show that in the long time limit the ``quantum\nmechanical'' behavior of the one-coin walk persists. We further show that this\nis generic for a very broad class of possible walks, and that this behavior\ndisappears only in the limit of a new coin for every step of the walk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2002 18:32:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
