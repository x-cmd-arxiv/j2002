First it\ncomputes the gravitational potential of a close binary accurately up to the\nquadraple moment, even when the binary is resolved only in the fine grids.\nSecond residual decreases by a factor of 300 or more by each iteration. We\nconfirmed experimentally that the iteration converges always to the exact\nsolution of the difference equation.

Without recourse to\nlocal filtering or entanglement concentration, using standard Bell-state\nmeasurement and classical communication one cannot teleport the state with unit\nfidelity and unit probability. We show that using non-maximally entangled\nmeasurements one can teleport an unknown state with unit fidelity albeit with\nreduced probability, hence probabilistic teleportation. We also give a\ngeneralized protocol for entanglement swapping using non-maximally entangled\nstates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2002 12:46:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
