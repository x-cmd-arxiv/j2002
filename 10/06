We calculate three observable quantities,\ncosmic ray spectrum, harmonic amplitude, and two point correlation function\nfrom our data of numerical simulations. With these quantities, we compare the\nresults of our numerical calculations with the observation. We show that the\nthree observable quantities including the GZK cutoff of the energy spectrum can\nbe reproduced in the case that the number fraction $\\sim 10^{-1.7}$ of the ORS\ngalaxies more luminous than -20.5 mag is selected as UHECR sources. In terms of\nthe source number density, this constraint corresponds to $10^{-6}$ Mpc$^{-3}$.\nHowever, since mean number of sources within the GZK sphere is only $\\sim 0.5$\nin this case, the AGASA 8 events above $10^{20.0}$ eV, which do not constitute\nthe clustered events with each other, can not be reproduced. On the other hand,\nif the cosmic ray flux measured by the HiRes, which is consistent with the GZK\ncutoff, is correct and observational features about the arrival distribution of\nUHECRs are same as the AGASA, our source model can explain both the arrival\ndistribution and the flux at the same time. Thus, we conclude that large\nfraction of the AGASA 8 events above $10^{20}$ eV might originate in the\ntopdown scenarios, or that the cosmic ray flux measured by the HiRes experiment\nmight be better.

We compute the risk-neutral probability\ndensity conditional on the total variance of the asset's returns when the\noption expires. If the asset's future price has finite expectation, the\noption's fair value satisfies a parabolic partial differential equation of the\nBlack-Scholes type in which the variance of the asset's returns rather than a\ntrading time is the evolution parameter. By immunizing the portfolio against\nlarge-scale price fluctuations of the asset, the valuation of options is\nextended to the realistic case\\cite{St99} of assets whose short-term returns\nhave finite variance but very large, or even infinite, higher moments. A\ndynamic Delta-hedged portfolio that is statically insured against exceptionally\nlarge fluctuations includes at least two different options on the asset. The\nfair value of an option in this case is determined by a universal drift\nfunction that is common to all options on the asset. This drift is interpreted\nas the premium for an investment exposed to risk due to exceptionally large\nvariations of the asset's price. It affects the option valuation like an\neffective cost-of-carry for the underlying in the Black-Scholes world would.\nThe derived pricing formula for options in realistic markets is arbitrage free\nby construction.
