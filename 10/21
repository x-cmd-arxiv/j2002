These galaxies, as measured from SDSS and\nin the Local Group, show tight correlations of internal velocity, metallicity\nand surface brightness (or radius) with M*. They define a fundamental line\ndistinguishing them from the brighter galaxies of high surface brightness and\nmetallicity. The idealized model assumes spherical collapse of CDM haloes to\nvirial equilibrium and angular-momentum conservation. The relations for bright\ngalaxies are reproduced by assuming that M* is a constant fraction of the halo\nmass M. The upper bound to the low-luminosity LSBs coincides with the virial\nvelocity of haloes in which supernova feedback could significantly suppress\nstar formation, V<100km/s (Dekel & Silk 1986). We argue that the energy fed to\nthe gas obeys E_sn \\prop M* despite the radiative losses, and equate it with\nthe binding energy of the gas to obtain M*/M \\prop V^2. This idealized model\nprovides surprisingly good fits to the scaling relations of low-luminosity LSBs\nand dwarfs, which indicates that supernova feedback had a primary role in\ndetermining the fundamental line. The apparent lower bound for galaxies at\nV~10km/s may be due to the cooling barrier at T~10^4 K. Some fraction of the\ndark haloes may show no stars due to complete gas removal either by supernova\nwinds from neighboring galaxies or by radiative feedback after cosmological\nreionization at z_ion. Radiative feedback may also explain the distinction\nbetween dwarf spheroidals (dE) and irregulars (dI), where the dEs of V<30km/s\nform stars before z_ion and are then cleaned out of gas, while the dIs with\nV>30km/s retain gas-rich discs with feedback-regulated star formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Oct 2002 20:02:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Dec 2003 18:29:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We stress the remarkable fact\nthat this extension is completely captured by the insertion of a fermionic\nexchange operator in the Hamiltonian: sCMS models ({\\it s} for supersymmetric)\nare nothing but special exchange-type CMS models. Under the appropriate\nprojection, the conserved charges can thus be formulated in terms of the\nstandard Dunkl operators. This is illustrated in the rational case, where the\nexplicit form of the 4N (N being the number of bosonic variables) conserved\ncharges is presented, together with their full algebra. The existence of 2N\ncommuting bosonic charges settles the question of the integrability of the\nsrCMS model. We then prove its superintegrability by displaying 2N-2 extra\nindependent charges commuting with the Hamiltonian. In the second part, we\nconsider the supersymmetric version of the trigonometric case (stCMS model) and\nreview the construction of its eigenfunctions, the Jack superpolynomials.

This reaction is one\nof the key reactions which could bridge the mass gap at A = 8 nuclear systems\nto produce intermediate-to-heavy mass elements in alpha- and neutron-rich\nenvironments such as r-process nucleosynthesis in supernova explosions,\ns-process nucleosynthesis in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, and\nprimordial nucleosynthesis in baryon inhomogeneous cosmological models. To\ncalculate the thermonuclear reaction rate in a wide range of temperatures, we\nnumerically integrate the thermal average of cross sections assuming a\ntwo-steps formation through a metastable $^{8}$Be. Off-resonant and on-resonant\ncontributions from the ground state in $^{8}$Be are taken into account. As\ninput cross section, we adopt the latest experimental data by\nphotodisintegration of $^{9}$Be with laser-electron photon beams, which covers\nall relevant resonances in $^{9}$Be. We provide the reaction rate for\n$\\alpha(\\alpha n,\\gamma)^{9}$Be in the temperature range from T$_{9}$=10$^{-3}$\nto T$_{9}$=10$^{1}$ both in the tabular form and in the analytical form. The\ncalculated reaction rate is compared with the reaction rates of the CF88 and\nthe NACRE compilations. The CF88 rate is valid at $T_{9} > 0.028$ due to lack\nof the off-resonant contribution. The CF88 rate differs from the present rate\nby a factor of two in a temperature range $T_{9} \\geq 0.1$. The NACRE rate,\nwhich adopted different sources of experimental information on resonance states\nin $^{9}$Be, is 4--12 times larger than the present rate at $T_{9} \\leq 0.028$,\nbut is consistent with the present rate to within $\\pm 20 %$ at $T_{9} \\geq\n0.1$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2002 07:01:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
