The Riemannian geometry is also obtained by means of a deformation of\nthe Euclidean geometry. Application of the deformation principle appears to be\nnot consecutive, and the Riemannian geometry appears to be not completely\nconsistent. Two different definitions of two vectors parallelism are\ninvestigated and compared. The first definitions is based on the deformation\nprinciple. The second definition is the conventional definition of parallelism,\nwhich is used in the Riemannian geometry. It is shown, that the second\ndefinition is inconsistent. It leads to absence of absolute parallelism in\nRiemannian geometry and to discrimination of outcome outside the framework of\nthe Riemannian geometry at description of the space-time geometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Oct 2002 10:09:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Oct 2002 14:24:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2002 13:42:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 22 Dec 2002 10:32:42 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 26 Jun 2003 10:25:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The problem of plant identification reduces to the problem of\nestimating the position of a single pair of complex conjugate poles. One\napproach to the problem is to apply the method of least squares to the time\ndomain data. This type of computation is best carried out in \"batch\" mode and\napplies to an entire data set. Another approach would be to design an adaptive\nfilter and to use autoregressive, AR, techniques. This would be well suited to\ncontinuous real-time data and could track slow changes on the underlying plant.\nI this paper we present a very fast but approximate technique for the\nestimation of the position of a single pair of complex conjugate poles, using\nthe Hilbert transform to reconstruct the analytic signal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Oct 2002 12:16:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-19"}
