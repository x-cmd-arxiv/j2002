Quantitative predictions for the late density profile\nare obtained therefrom, and validated by numerical simulations. The main result\nis a scaling regime for the density profile of a collapsing object of mass $M$\naround cosmological coordinate $r^*$, $\\rho(r)\\sim\n\\frac{M}{d}(\\frac{|r-r^*|}{d})^{-{1/4}}$. The characteristic scale of the\nagglomeration, $d\\sim (t/t_0)^{{4/9}}$, is an increasing function of\ncosmological time $t$. The major part of the mass hence always lies in a region\nwith decreasing mass density. This shows that one-dimensional self-gravitating\nmotion is not sufficient to effectively drive structure formation in an\nEinstein-de Sitter Universe. These results are compared with analogous\ninvestigations for the adhesion model (Burgers equation with positive\nviscosity), where the agglomeration is faster, and one-dimensional dynamics is\neffective. We further study the mutual motion of two mass agglomerations, and\nshow that they oscillate around each other for long times, like two ``heavy\nparticles''. Individual particles in the two agglomerations do not mix\neffectively on the time scale of the interagglomeration motion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Oct 2002 09:50:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

The system directly applies to the description of\ngravity-capillary waves on the surface of a liquid layer flowing down an\ninclined plane, with a surfactant diffusing along the layer's surface.\nActually, the model is quite general, offering a simple way to stabilize\nnonlinear waves in media combining the weakly-2D dispersion of the KP type with\ngain and NWS dissipation. Parallel to this, another model is introduced, whose\ndissipative terms are isotropic, rather than of the NWS type. Both models\ninclude an additional linear equation of the advection-diffusion type, linearly\ncoupled to the main KP-NWS equation. The extra equation provides for stability\nof the zero background in the system, opening a way to the existence of stable\nlocalized pulses.

In this scheme, quantum gates can\nbe implemented based on the total phase accumulated in cyclic evolutions. In\nparticular, geometric quantum computation may be achieved by eliminating the\ndynamic phase accumulated in the whole evolution. Therefore, both dynamic and\ngeometric operations for quantum computation are workable in the present\ntheory. Physical implementation of this set of gates is designed for NMR\nsystems. Also interestingly, we show that a set of universal geometric quantum\ngates in NMR systems may be realized in one cycle by simply choosing specific\nparameters of the external rotating magnetic fields. In addition, we\ndemonstrate explicitly a multiloop method to remove the dynamic phase in\ngeometric quantum gates.
