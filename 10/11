A general formula is given\nfor the oscillation period to describe population transfer from the initial\npolar state to other spin states. We show that when the frequency and the\nreduced amplitude of the longitudinal magnetic field are related in a specific\nmanner, the population of the initial spin-0 state will be dynamically\nlocalized during time evolution. The effects of external noise and nonlinear\nspin exchange interaction on the dynamics of the spinor BEC are studied. We\nshow that while the external noise may eventually destroy the Rabi oscillations\nand dynamic spin localization, these coherent phenomena are robust against the\nnonlinear atomic interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Oct 2002 03:08:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

It is shown\nthat when the metric in a manifold has a certain form, a set of canonically\nconjugate variables Xk and Pk in which Pk are incompressible, can be\nconstructed.

The controversy related to non-uniqueness of\nmomentum operators when the range of a coordinate is a finite interval is\nreduced to two possible extensions.

The main idea of the\nmethod used for the analysis is creation of special empirical models based on\nartificial neural networks. These models which are in essence the nonlinear\nextension of commonly used linear statistical models are believed to provide\nthe best fit for the real (nonlinear) PM-NOx-VOC relationships under different\natmospheric conditions. It is believed that such models may be useful in\ncontext of various scientific and practical problems concerning atmospheric\naerosols. The method is demonstrated by the example of two empirical models\ncreated with independent data-sets collected at two air quality monitoring\nstations at South Coast Air Basin, California. It is shown that in spite of\nconsiderable distance between the monitoring stations (more than 50 km) and\nthus substantially different environmental conditions, the empirical models\nmanifest several common qualitative features. Specifically, it is found that,\nunder definite conditions, the decrease of the level of NOx or VOC may lead to\nthe increase of mass concentration of aerosol. It is argued that these features\nare caused by the nonlinear dependence of hydroxyl radical on VOC and NOx.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Oct 2002 13:50:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2002 15:38:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-04"}

Bohr proposed to redefine the `objectivity' essential for\nscientific description in terms of the epistemological demand for unambiguously\ncommunicable descriptions of observational results, a move which has profound\nconsequences for how we can understand the concept of the quantum mechanical\nstate and the nature of the `system' which is `in' this state. Here it is\nargued that the old notion of the `object' which is in a classical mechanical\nstate is drawn from a substance/property ontology derived from Aristotle's\nanalysis of categorical propositions. In moving to describing a system in a\nquantum mechanical state, the system that is `in' such a state can no longer be\nso regarded as a substance possessing properties. Bohr argues that the concept\nrefers to an interaction which has a feature of wholeness or `individuality'\nthat implies that the distinction between `object system' and `observing\nsystem' is relative to the context of the description. This conclusion, in\nturn, implies the need for a combination of complementary modes of description;\nhowever, because of his reticence in making ontological claims, he failed to\ndevelop this dimension of his new framework of complementarity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2002 19:43:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
