It is found that the N/O values in HII regions of spiral galaxies\nof early morphological types are higher than those in HII regions with the same\nmetallicity in spiral galaxies of late morphological types. This suggests a\nlong-time-delayed contribution to the nitrogen production. The N/O ratio of a\ngalaxy can then be used as an indicator of the time that has elapsed since the\nbulk of star formation occurred, or in other words of the nominal \"age\" of the\ngalaxy as suggested by Edmunds and Pagel more than twenty years ago. The\nscatter in N/O values at a given O/H can be naturally explained by differences\nin star formation histories in galaxies. While low-metallicity dwarf galaxies\nwith low N/O do not contain an appreciable amount of old stars, low-metallicity\ndwarf galaxies with an appreciable fraction of old stars have high N/O.\nConsideration of planetary nebulae in the Small Magellanic Cloud and in the\nMilky Way Galaxy suggests that the contribution of low-mass stars to the\nnitrogen production is significant, confirming the conclusion that there is a\nlong-time-delayed contribution to the nitrogen production.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2002 13:29:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Theories of\nthis type considered before have had problems accommodating the standard model\nfermion content and Yukawa couplings different from the gauge coupling.\nConsidering orbifolds based on abelian discrete groups we are lead to a 6\ndimensional G_2 gauge theory compactified on T^2/Z_4. This theory can naturally\nproduce the SM Higgs fields with the right quantum numbers while predicting the\nvalue of the weak mixing angle sin^2 theta_W = 0.25 at the tree-level, close to\nthe experimentally observed one. The quartic scalar coupling for the Higgs is\ngenerated by the higher dimensional gauge interaction and predicts the\nexistence of a light Higgs. We point out that one can write a quadratically\ndivergent counter term for Higgs mass localized to the orbifold fixed point.\nHowever, we calculate these operators and show that higher dimensional gauge\ninteractions do not generate them at least at one loop. Fermions are introduced\nat orbifold fixed points, making it easy to accommodate the standard model\nfermion content. Yukawa interactions are generated by Wilson lines. They may be\ngenerated by the exchange of massive bulk fermions, and the fermion mass\nhierarchy can be obtained. Around a TeV, the first KK modes would appear as\nwell as additional fermion modes localized at the fixed point needed to cancel\nthe quadratic divergences from the Yukawa interactions. The cutoff scale of the\ntheory could be a few times 10 TeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2002 18:09:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Jun 2003 17:50:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

We extend these effects to arbitrary direction\nof the magnetic dipole. The precise conditions for having nondispersive\nprecession and interference effects in these generalized set ups are delineated\nboth classically and quantally. Under these conditions the dipole is affected\nby a nonvanishing torque that causes pure precession around the directions\ndefined by the ideal set ups. It is shown that the precession angles are in the\nquantal case linearly related to the ideal phase differences, and that the\nnonideal phase differences are nonlinearly related to the ideal phase\ndifferences. It is argued that the latter nonlinearity is due the appearance of\na geometric phase associated with the nontrivial spin path. It is further\ndemonstrated that the spatial force vanishes in all cases except in the\nclassical treatment of the nonideal AC set up, where the occurring force has to\nbe compensated by the experimental arrangement. Finally, for a closed\nspace-time loop the local precession effects can be inferred from the\ninterference pattern characterized by the nonideal phase differences and the\nvisibilities. It is argued that this makes it natural to regard SAB and AC as\nessentially local and nontopological effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2002 13:15:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

To this end we give a general strategy for\nusing dynamical decoupling operations on encoded subspaces. These encodings may\nbe of any form; of particular importance are decoherence-free subspaces and\nquantum error correction codes. We then give means for empirically determining\nan appropriate set of dynamical decoupling operations for a given experiment.\nUsing these techniques, we then propose a comprehensive encoding solution to\nmany of the problems of quantum computing proposals which use exchange-type\ninteractions. This uses a decoherence-free subspace and an efficient set of\ndynamical decoupling operations. It also addresses the problems of\ncontrollability in solid state quantum dot devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2002 15:49:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
