Two spectroscopic epochs appeared to show that the\nH-alpha was variable, decreasing from 121 Angstroms to 25 Angstroms EW, which I\ninterpreted as a flare during the first observation. Gizis (2002) independently\ndiscovered this object, and his intermediate spectroscopic epoch shows H-alpha\nwith 97 Angstroms EW. A new fourth epoch of spectroscopy again shows a very\nlarge H-alpha EW (124 Angstroms), confirming this object to be a persistent,\nstrong H-alpha emitter. Whether the H-alpha is steady (like 2MASS 1237+6526) or\nfrom continuous strong flaring (like PC0025+0447) remains unclear. Imaging\nconfirms that 2MASS 1315-2649 has a high proper motion (0.71\"/year),\ncorresponding to a transverse velocity of ~76 km/s at its distance of ~23 pc.\nThus 2MASS 1315-2649 is consistent with being >~2 Gyr old and therefore\nrelatively massive. If that is so, the correlation of H-alph activity with mass\nfound by Gizis et al.

The simplest\napproximation beyond the linear-motion assumption is to add a constant\nacceleration. Microlensing light curves due to accelerations can be symmetric\nor asymmetric depending on the angle between the acceleration and the velocity.\nWe show that it is possible that some of the previously reported shorter\nmarginal parallax events can be reproduced with constant-acceleration models,\nwhile the longer, multi-year parallax events are ill-fitted by such models. We\nfind that there is a generic degeneracy inherent in constant-acceleration\nmicrolensing models.

The\nimportance of this new parallax degeneracy is illustrated with an example,\nusing one of these marginal parallax events.

It has been classified as a compact symmetric source (CSO) due\nto its small overall size (~220 pc) and twin-jet morphology, although it also\nhas faint extended emission that may be a relic of previous activity. We report\nthe detection of exceedingly high linear fractional polarization in isolated\nfeatures of the southern jet (up to 60%), which is highly unusual for a CSO.\nGiven the large amount of gas present in the host galaxy, we would expect\nsignificant Faraday depolarization across the whole source, unless the\ndepolarizing gas is fairly clumpy.

The two solutions for measured\nmoduli |Sbar|^2 and |S|^2 of the two S-wave transversity amplitudes Sbar and S\nshow res onant behaviour below 800 MeV corresponding to a scalar resonance\nsigma(770). Simultaneous fits to |Sbar|^2 and |S|^2 include f_0(980). The CERN\ndata on polar ized target supplemented by the assumption of analyticity of\nproduction amplitud es in dipion mass allow to determine the helicity\namplitudes S_0 (a_1 exchange) and S_1 (pi exchange) from fitted transversity\namplitudes. The sign ambiguity in sigma(770) contribution leads to 2 solutions.\nIn the \"down\" solution sigma(770) is suppressed in the helicity flip amplitude\nS_1 and thus also in pi(-)pi(+)-> pi(-)pi(+) scattering. Most contribution of\nsigma(770) to pion production is in the nonflip amplitude S_0, or in\npi(-)a_1(+)->pi(-)pi(+) scattering. In the \"up\" solution the situation is\nreversed.

The effect is cumulative in\nthe sense that all fluctuation modes contribute to the change in the background\ngeometry, and as a consequence the back-reaction effect can be large even if\nthe amplitude of the fluctuation spectrum is small. We review two approaches\nused to quantify back-reaction. In the first approach, the effect of the\nfluctuations on the background is expressed in terms of an effective\nenergy-momentum tensor. We show that in the context of an inflationary\nbackground cosmology, the long wavelength contributions to the effective\nenergy-momentum tensor take the form of a negative cosmological constant, whose\nabsolute value increases as a function of time since the phase space of\ninfrared modes is increasing. This then leads to the speculation that\ngravitational back-reaction may lead to a dynamical cancellation mechanism for\na bare cosmological constant, and yield a scaling fixed point in the asymptotic\nfuture in which the remnant cosmological constant satisfies $\\Omega_{\\Lambda}\n\\sim 1$. We then discuss how infrared modes effect local observables (as\nopposed to mathematical background quantities) and find that the leading\ninfrared back-reaction contributions cancel in single field inflationary\nmodels.

The\nsystem proves to have different types of motion including L\\'{e}vy flights and\nchaotic walkings of an atom in a cavity. It is shown that the translational\nmotion, related to the atom recoils, is governed by an equation of a parametric\nnonlinear pendulum with a frequency modulated by the Rabi oscillations. This\ntype of dynamics is chaotic with some width of the stochastic layer that is\nestimated analytically. The width is fairly small for realistic values of the\ncontrol parameters, the normalized detuning $\\delta$ and atomic recoil\nfrequency $\\alpha$. It is demonstrated how the atom-photon dynamics with a\ngiven value of $\\alpha$ depends on the values of $\\delta$ and initial\nconditions.

We\ncalculate the achievable resolution, highlighting its connection to the fringe\nvisibility in an interference experiment. We show that seemingly different\nphysical pictures, such as spatial averaging, phase modulation, and which-way\ninformation, describe the situation equally and lead to identical results. The\nconnection to Bohr's moving slit experiment is pointed out.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2002 22:27:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
