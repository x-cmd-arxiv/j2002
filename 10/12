Laser light is guided by optical fibers or\noptical micro-structures via the atom to a photo-detector. Our results suggest\nthat with present-day technology, micro-cavities can be built around the atom\nwith sufficiently high finesse to permit unambiguous detection of a single atom\nin the trap with 10 $\\mu$s of integration. We compare resonant and non-resonant\ndetection schemes and we discuss the requirements for detecting an atom without\ncausing it to undergo spontaneous emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Oct 2002 17:50:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The quantum algorithm\nexploiting superposition and entanglement is more efficient than the classical\none because the quantum algorithm requires less memory.
