We find that the SFR of galaxies is strongly\ncorrelated with the local (projected) galaxy density and thus we present here\nthe density-SFR relation that is analogous to the density-morphology relation.\nThe effect of density on the SFR of galaxies is seen in three ways. First, the\noverall distribution of SFRs is shifted to lower values in dense environments\ncompared with the field population. Second, the effect is most noticeable for\nthe strongly star-forming galaxies in the 75th percentile of the SFR\ndistribution. Third, there is a ``break'' (or characteristic density) in the\ndensity-SFR relation at a local galaxy density of 1h-2 Mpc-2. To understand\nthis break further, we have studied the SFR of galaxies as a function of\nclustercentric radius from 17 clusters and groups objectively selected from the\nSDSS EDR data. The distribution of SFRs of cluster galaxies begins to change,\ncompared with the field population, at a clustercentric radius of 3-4 virial\nradii, which is consistent with the characteristic break in density that we\nobserve in the density-SFR relation. Our tests suggest that the\ndensity-morphology relation alone is unlikely to explain the density-SFR\nrelation we observe. Taken all together, these works demonstrate that the\ndecrease in SFR of galaxies in dense environments is a universal phenomenon\nover a wide range in density (from 0.08 to 10h-2 Mpc-2) and redshift (out to z\n= 0.5).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2002 20:25:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

When steady state is reached, spectra and\ntime correlation functions of kinetic energy and bond length fluctuations\nindicate that most normal modes have been activated, but the motion remains\nquasi-periodic or regular. By contrast, when the molecule is violently excited\nor embedded in a thermal bath (modelled by Langevin dynamics), the same markers\nclearly depict chaotic motions. Thus it appears that even such a large system\nof oscillators is unable to provide the equivalent of a thermal bath to any one\nof these, unless there are strong resonances between some of them. In general,\ntherefore, an energy of a few eV's deposited in an isolated molecule will not\nbe immediately thermalized.

However, it\ncertainly provokes a number of specific questions and suggests the existence of\nnovel phenomena in nuclear physics which are not part of the the traditional\nframework of the meson-nucleon description of nuclei. Many of these phenomena\nare related to high nuclear densities and the role of color in nucleonic\ninteractions. Quantum fluctuations in the spatial separation between nucleons\nmay lead to local high density configurations of cold nuclear matter in nuclei,\nup to four times larger than typical nuclear densities. We argue here that\nexperiments utilizing the higher energies available upon completion of the\nJefferson Laboratory energy upgrade will be able to probe the quark-gluon\nstructure of such high density configurations and therefore elucidate the\nfundamental nature of nuclear matter. We review three key experimental\nprograms: quasi-elastic electro-disintegration of light nuclei, deep inelastic\nscattering from nuclei at $x>1$, and the measurement of tagged structure\nfunctions. These interrelated programs are all aimed at the exploration of the\nquark structure of high density nuclear configurations.\n  The study of the QCD dynamics of elementary hard processes is another\nimportant research direction and nuclei provide a unique avenue to explore\nthese dynamics.

We provide a rigorous definition\nof a transcription module as the object to be retrieved from the expression\ndata. An efficient algorithm, that searches for the modules encoded in the data\nby iteratively refining sets of genes and conditions until they match this\ndefinition, is established. Each iteration involves a linear map, induced by\nthe normalized expression matrix, followed by the application of a threshold\nfunction. We argue that our method is in fact a generalization of Singular\nValue Decomposition, which corresponds to the special case where no threshold\nis applied. We show analytically that for noisy expression data our approach\nleads to better classification due to the implementation of the threshold. This\nresult is confirmed by numerical analyses based on in-silico expression data.\nWe discuss briefly results obtained by applying our algorithm to expression\ndata from the yeast S. cerevisiae.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2002 16:44:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The observed optical transition strength at 7-8.5 eV region shows a\ncomplex structure arising from coupling to C-C stretch motion, to torsional\nmotion, and to Rydberg excitations. The mean energy of the observed peak is\nreproduced to about 0.2 eV accuracy by the TDDFT in the local density\napproximation (LDA). The reflection approximation is used to calculate the peak\nbroadening. Roughly half of the broadening can be attributed to the fluctuation\nin the C-C coordinate. The asymmetry in the line shape is also qualitatively\nreproduced by the C-C coordinate fluctuation. We find, in agreement with other\ntheoretical studies, that the torsional motion is responsible for the\nprogression of weak transition strength extending from the peak down to about 6\neV.
