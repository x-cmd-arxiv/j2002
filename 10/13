This model predicts the\ndeconfinement phase transition of the crossover type. The so-called \"softest\npoint\" effect of EoS is analyzed and confronted to that for other equations of\nstate which exhibit the first order phase transition (two-phase bag model) or\nno transition at all (hadron resonance gas). It is demonstrated that the beam\nenergy dependence of the directed flow is a smooth function in the whole range\nfrom SIS till SPS energies and allows to disentangle different EoS, being in\ngood agreement with experimental data for the statistical mixed-phase model. In\ncontrast, excitation functions for relative strangeness abundance turn out to\nbe insensitive to the order of phase transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Oct 2002 10:20:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
