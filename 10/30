From an augmented Lagrangian which incorporates the\nsynchronization constraints both as soft and hard constraints, a network is\nderived wherein the local minimizers interact and exchange information through\nthe synchronization constraints. From the viewpoint of neural networks, the\narray can be considered as a Lagrange programming network for continuous\noptimization and as a cellular neural network (CNN). The penalty weights\nassociated with the soft state synchronization constraints follow from the\nsolution to a linear program. This expresses that the energy cost of the\nensemble should maximally decrease. In this way successful local minimizers can\nimplicitly impose their state to the others through a mechanism of master-slave\ndynamics resulting into a cooperative search mechanism. Improved information\nspreading within the ensemble is obtained by applying the concept of\nsmall-world networks.

The spacetimes that are\nevolved from initial data near the black hole threshold have many properties\nthat are mathematically analogous to a critical phase transition in statistical\nmechanics.\n  Solutions near the black hole threshold go through an intermediate attractor,\ncalled the critical solution.
