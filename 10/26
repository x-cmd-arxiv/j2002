This is undertaken via an analytical model\nfor the resonant Hamiltonian function. The results are compared with those of\nnumerical simulations of the exact equations.\n  In the 2/1 commensurability, we show the existence of three principal\nfamilies of stationary solutions: (i) aligned orbits, in which theta_1 and\nvarpi_1 - varpi_2 both librate around zero, (ii) anti-aligned orbits, in which\ntheta_1=0 and the difference in pericenter is 180 degrees, and (iii) asymmetric\nstationary solutions, where both the resonant angle and varpi_1 - varpi_2 are\nconstants with values different of 0 or 180 degrees.

One is allowed to\nfail, but not to make a mistake. The optimal procedure is the one with the\nlowest failure probability. This procedure has been extended to bipartite\nstates where the two parties, Alice and Bob, are allowed to manipulate their\nparticles locally and communicate classically in order to determine which of\ntwo possible two-particle states they have been given. The failure probability\nof this local procedure has been shown to be the same as if the particles were\ntogether in the same location. Here we examine the effect of restricting the\nclassical communication between the parties, either allowing none or\neliminating the possibility that one party's measurement depends on the result\nof the other party's. These issues are studied for two-qubit states, and\noptimal procedures are found. In some cases the restrictions cause increases in\nthe failure probability, but in other cases they do not. Applications of these\nprocedures, in particular to secret sharing, are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Oct 2002 21:09:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

In this paper, we study one possible route to\nclassical behavior for the discrete quantum walk on the line: the presence of\ndecoherence in the quantum ``coin'' which drives the walk. We find exact\nanalytical expressions for the time dependence of the first two moments of\nposition, and show that in the long-time limit the variance grows linearly with\ntime, unlike the unitary walk. We compare this to the results of direct\nnumerical simulation, and see how the form of the position distribution changes\nfrom the unitary to the usual classical result as we increase the strength of\nthe decoherence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Oct 2002 22:57:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Mar 2003 17:12:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
