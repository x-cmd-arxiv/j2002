Whereas a global fit\nto the latest data shows that some relation seems not to be favorable for a\nconsistent explanation to the current data within the standard model (SM). By\nconsidering several patterns of SU(3) breaking, the amplitudes and the\ncorresponding strong phases are extracted and compared with the theoretical\nestimations. It is found that in the case of SU(3) limits and also the case\nwith SU(3) breaking only in amplitudes, the fitting results lead to an\nunexpected large ratio between two isospin amplitudes\n$a^{c}_{3/2}/a^{u}_{3/2}$, which is about an order of magnitude larger than the\nSM prediction. The results are found to be insensitive to the weak phase\n$\\gamma$. By including SU(3) breaking effects on the strong phases, one is able\nto obtain a consistent fit to the current data within the SM, which implies\nthat the SU(3) breaking effect on strong phases may play an important role in\nunderstanding the observed charmless hadronic B decay modes $B\\to \\pi \\pi$ and\n$\\pi K$. It is possible to test those breaking effects in the near future from\nmore precise measurements of direct CP violation in B factories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Oct 2002 16:41:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2002 14:11:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 27 Aug 2003 12:33:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-13"}

We end up with an\nattractive model and we study several phenomenological questions, such as gauge\ncoupling unification, proton stability, fermion masses and neutrino\noscillations. At the string scale, the gauge group is U(3)_color x U(2)_weak x\nU(1)_1 x U(1)_bulk. The corresponding gauge bosons are localized on three\ncollections of branes; two of them describe the strong and weak interactions,\nwhile the last abelian factor lives on a brane which is extended in two large\nextra dimensions with a size of afew microns. The hypercharge is a linear\ncombination of the first three U(1)s. All remaining U(1)s get masses at the TeV\nscale due to anomalies, leaving the baryon and lepton numbers as\n(perturbatively) unbroken global symmetries at low energies. The conservation\nof baryon number assures proton stability, while lepton number symmetry\nguarantees light neutrino masses that involve a right-handed neutrino in the\nbulk. The model predicts the value of the weak angle which is compatible with\nthe experiment when the string scale is in the TeV region. It also contains two\nHiggs doublets that provide tree-level masses to all fermions of the heaviest\ngeneration, with calculable Yukawa couplings; one obtains a naturally heavy top\nand the correct ratio m_b/m_tau. We also study neutrino masses and mixings in\nrelation to recent solar and atmospheric neutrino data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2002 12:44:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 May 2003 15:32:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Growth of the code from 16 codons\nin the NAN column (N, any standard nucleotide) proceeded by assignment of\ncodons in the GNN, ANN, CNN and UNN rows. Expansion phase (stage 4 to 7)\nprecursor/product pairs that spanned this shift included aspartate/threonine,\naspartate/methionine and glutamate/proline. Both 5' and mid-base differ in the\ncodons of each of these pairs. Second, post-expansion additions (stage 9 to 14)\nrequired codon reassignment, eliminating initial correlations. Codons for the\npost-expansion pair, aspartate (glutamate)/arginine, also differ at both 5' and\nmid-base sites. Third, the distribution of core structure groups among\nacceptors indicated that variant tRNA specific for a sibling, rather than\nprecursor, commonly participated as cofactors in early amino acid synthesis.\nSibling pairs, rather than precursor/product pairs, then exhibit codon\ncorrelations. On removing these sources of variation, highly significant\ncorrelations emerged between codons assigned to biosynthetically related amino\nacids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2002 10:50:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The RF electric field,\ncurrent, and power deposition profiles were different, especially at 1mTorr,\nfor which the electron effective mean free path was larger than the skin depth.\nThe plasma density predicted by the Maxwellian EEDF was up to 93% larger for\nthe conditions examined.
