In particular, the\nwings of the Na-D (5890 \\AA) and K I (7700 \\AA) resonance lines come to define\nthe continuum and dominate the spectrum of T dwarfs from 0.4 to 1.0 \\mic.\nWhereas in standard stellar atmospheres the strengths and shapes of the wings\nof atomic spectral lines are rarely needed beyond 25 \\AA of a line center, in\nbrown dwarfs the far wings of the Na and K resonance lines out to 1000's of \\AA\ndetunings are important. Using standard quantum chemical codes and the Unified\nFranck-Condon model for line profiles in the quasi-static limit, we calculate\nthe interaction potentials and the wing line shapes for the dominant Na and K\nresonance lines in H$_2$- and helium-rich atmospheres. Our theory has natural\nabsorption profile cutoffs, has no free parameters, and is readily adapted to\nspectral synthesis calculations for stars, brown dwarfs, and planets with\neffective temperatures below 2000 Kelvin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Oct 2002 00:05:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Several clumps of size ~0.08 pc were found for\neach line distributed all over the region where previous single-dish emission\nwas found (Morata et al. 1997). Each molecular transition traces differently\nthe clump distribution, although in some cases the detected clumps are\ncoincident. The distribution of the N2H+ emission and the single-dish NH3\nemission are coincident and compatible with an origin in the same gas. The\nlarge fraction of missing flux measured for the CS (2-1) transition can be\nexplained if the cloud is formed by a clumpy and heterogeneous medium. Four\npositions were selected to derive the abundance ratios [N2H+/CS] and [HCO+/CS]\nfrom the molecular column density determinations, and to compare them with the\nvalues predicted by the chemical model. The model was able to explain the\ninterferometric observations, and, in particular, the chemical differentiation\nof the detected clumps and the coincidence of the NH3 and N2H+ emissions. The\nlack of HCO+ towards the two selected positions that trace the more evolved\nclumps cannot be accounted for by the model, but it is possibly due to strong\nself-absorption. We propose a classification of the studied clumps according to\nthe stage of chemical evolution indicated by the molecular abundances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Oct 2002 11:55:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

While the fast process,\nlocated at GHz-THz, can be interpreted as encaged molecular motion, the\noccurrence of the boson peak (BP), dominating at THz frequencies, still is\ncontroversially debated. Two scenarios have evolved during recent years: the BP\nis truly collective in nature or, alternatively, it results from localized\nmodes. To help solving this controversy, we have investigated the\nhigh-frequency dielectric loss of plastic crystals (PCs), having long-range\ntranslational but no orientational order. Having in mind the well-defined\nphonon modes in PCs compared to canonical glasses, and the infrared silence of\nacoustic phonon modes, millimeter-wave and far-infrared spectroscopy should\nprovide valuable hints on the true origin of the BP. Here we show that PCs\nexhibit a BP-like feature with markedly different spectral shape compared to\ncanonical glasses, evidencing that mixing of collective phonon with local\nrelaxational modes causes the BP. In addition, we find clear evidence for a\nfast process also in PCs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Oct 2002 20:27:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2004 22:30:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Starting with full five-dimensional\nequations, we derive four-dimensional effective equations which govern the\nlow-energy dynamics of brane worlds. A correspondent five-dimensional geometry\nis also obtained. The effective four-dimensional theory on a positive tension\nbrane is described by bi-scalar tensor theory. If the radion is stabilized, the\neffective theory becomes Brans-Dicke (BD) theory with BD parameter $1/2 b^2$.\nOn the other hand, if the scalar field is stabilized, the effective theory\nbecomes scalar-tensor theory with BD parameter\n$\\frac{3}{2(3b^2+1)}\\frac{\\phi(t)}{1-\\phi(t)}$ where $\\phi$ is the BD field\ndefined by radion $d(t)$. If we do not introduce the stabilization mechanism\nfor these moduli fields, the acceptable late time cosmology can be realized\nonly if the dilaton coupling $b$ is small ($b^2 < 1.6 \\times 10^{-4}$) and the\nnegative tension brane is sufficiently away from the positive tension brane. We\nalso construct several models for inflationary brane worlds driven by\npotentials on the brane and in the bulk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Oct 2002 15:37:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Jan 2003 00:46:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

For all Re < 500, transient growth is enhanced by\ncurvature, i.e. is greater for eta < 1 than for eta = 1, the plane Couette\nlimit. For fixed Re < 130 it is found that the greatest transient growth is\nachieved for eta between the Taylor-Couette linear stability boundary, if it\nexists, and one, while for Re > 130 the greatest transient growth is achieved\nfor eta on the linear stability boundary. Transient growth is shown to be\napproximately 20% higher near the linear stability boundary at Re = 310, eta =\n0.986 than at Re = 310, eta = 1, near the threshold observed for transition in\nplane Couette flow.

An AC current is driven through the\nelastic element which, in the presence of a magnetic field, causes an AC force\non the element. When the frequency of the AC current matches the resonant\nfrequency of the element, maximum vibration of the element occurs and this can\nbe measured precisely by optical means. We have built and tested a model sensor\nof this type using for the elastic element a length of copper wire of diameter\n0.030 mm formed into a loop shape. The wire motion was measured using a light\nemitting diode photo-transistor assembly. This sensor demonstrated a\nsensitivity better than 0.001G for an applied magnetic field of $ \\sim 1$G and\na good selectivity for the magnetic field direction.
