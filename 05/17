Its X-ray peculiarities have led to a controversy\nconcerning their origin: either from wind infall onto a putative degenerate\ncompanion, as for typical Be/X-ray binaries, or from the Be star per se. Recent\nprogress has been made to address this: (1) the discovery that gamma Cas is an\neccentric binary system (P = 203.59 d) with unknown secondary type, (2) the\naccumulation of RXTE data at 9 epochs in 1996-2000, and (3) the collation of\nrobotic telescope B, V-band photometric observations over 4 seasons.

This\ncontradicts the binary accretion model, which predicts a substantial\nmodulation. However,these fluxes correlate well with the cyclical optical\nvariations. Also, the 6 flux measurements in 2000 closely track the\ninterpolated optical variations between the 2000 and 2001 observing seasons.\nSince the optical variations represent a far greater energy than that emitted\nas X-rays, the optical variability cannot arise from X-ray reprocessing.\nHowever, the strong correlation between the two suggests that they are driven\nby a common mechanism.

Roughness-driven contributions to\nhydrodynamic flows, energy dissipation, and friction force are calculated in a\nwide range of parameters. When the hydrodynamic decay length (the viscous wave\npenetration depth) is larger than the size of random surface inhomogeneities,\nit is possible to replace a random rough surface by effective stick-slip\nboundary conditions on a flat surface with two constants: the stick-slip length\nand the renormalization of viscosity near the boundary.

In $p$-type\nquantum wells both weak localization and weak anti-localization are present due\nto the strong spin-orbit interaction. When determining the total conductivity\ncorrection one also have to include the term due to hole-hole interaction. The\nmagnitude of the latter depends on the ratio between the thermal energy and the\nFermi energy, $k_{\\rm B}T/E_{\\rm F}$ and whether the system can be considered\nas ballistic $(k_{\\rm B}T \\tau_{\\rm tr} / \\hbar>1)$ or diffusive ($k_{\\rm B}T\n\\tau_{\\rm tr}/\\hbar<1$).

For instance, we predict that a spin\nmeasurement in the rest frame of a massive gravitino will yield the result 3/2\nwith probability one half, and 1/2 with probability one half. The simplest\nscenario leaves the Riemannian curvature unaltered; thus avoiding conflicts\nwith classical tests of the theory of general relativity. However, the quantum\nstructure acquires additional contributions to the propagators, and it gives\nrise to additional phases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 May 2002 21:28:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
