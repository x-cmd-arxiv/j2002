In particular, it encloses all dynamically\nstable mass while, outside it, dynamical stability is lost soon. Particles can\npass through such BL, which however acts as a confinement barrier for dynamical\nproperties. BL is set by evaluating kinetic and potential energies (T(r) and\nW(r)) and calculating R=-2T/W. Then, on BL, R has a minimum which closely\napproaches a maximum of w= -dlog W/dlog r. Such $Rw$ ``requirement'' is\nconsistent with virial equilibrium, but implies further regularities. We test\nthe presence of a BL around haloes in spatially flat CDM simulations, with or\nwithout cosmological constant. We find that the mass M_c, enclosed within the\nradius r_c, where the $Rw$ requirement is fulfilled, closely approaches the\nmass M_{dyn}, evaluated from the velocities of all particles within r_c,\naccording to the virial theorem.

We consider these estimates on\nthe basis of subsequent theoretical and experimental evidence, and pay\nattention in particular to the inhomogeneity of the electron gas. This\ninhomogeneity gives rise to local-field effects, which are mentioned by Cohen\nand Anderson, however without an explicit estimate of their effect on Tc. They\nclaim that strong local-field effects cause a transition to covalent bonds,\nwhich inhibits superconductivity. We consider here strong local-field effects\nby making use of the inverse dielectric matrix (in reciprocal space), which we\nreview in some detail. We distinguish between the electronic and ionic\ndielectric matrices, and show that the later can give rise to much stronger\nlocal fields, because of the inherent local nature of the ions (in contrast\nwith the delocalised nature of the conduction electrons). Moreover, the ionic\ndielectric matrix is large only at very low frequencies omega (below the\ndispersion frequency of the dielectric constant), therefore the strong\nlocal-field effects do not cause the instability leading to the formation of\ncovalent bonds. As a result, the maximum Tc can be much higher than the value\nestimated by Cohen and Anderson, and by McMillan, and can reach about 200 K in\nnearly-ferroelectric materials like the high-Tc cuprates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 May 2002 08:50:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The key innovation is\nthat generic traversal is covered. To this end, we define a typed rewriting\ncalculus S'_{gamma}.

We consider two generic strategy\ntypes, namely the types of type-preserving and type-unifying strategies.\nS'_{gamma} offers traversal combinators to construct traversals or schemes\nthereof from many-sorted and generic strategies. The traversal combinators\nmodel different forms of one-step traversal, that is, they process the\nimmediate subterms of a given term without anticipating any scheme of recursion\ninto terms. To inhabit generic types, we need to add a fundamental combinator\nto lift a many-sorted strategy $s$ to a generic type gamma. This step is called\nstrategy extension.
