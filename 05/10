Both static and dynamical information can be obtained. In this work\nit was possible to analyze up to 12x12 site clusters at low temperatures\nranging between 0.01t and 0.1t (between 50K and 500K for a hopping amplitude $t\n\\sim 0.5 eV$). As the temperature is reduced, spectral weight is transferred\nfrom high to low frequencies in agreement with the behavior observed\nexperimentally. Varying the hole density, the Drude weight has a maximum at the\noptimal doping for the model, i.e., at the density where the pairing\ncorrelations are stronger. It was also observed that the inverse of the Drude\nweight, roughly proportional to the resistivity, decreases linearly with the\ntemperature at optimal doping, and it is abruptly reduced when robust pairing\ncorrelations develop upon further reducing the temperature. The behavior and\ngeneral form of the optical conductivity are found to be in good agreement with\nexperimental results for the cuprates.

We know that for arbitrary and random\nsharing but locally conserving money transactions, the money distribution goes\nto the Gibb's distribution of statistical mechanics. We then consider the\neffects of savings, etc. and see how the distribution changes. We also propose\na new model where the agents invest equal amounts of money in each transaction.\nWe find that for short time-periods, the money distribution obeys a power-law\nwith an exponent very close to unity, and has an exponential tail; after a very\nlong time, this distribution collapses and the entire amount of money goes to a\ntiny fraction of the population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 May 2002 15:43:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

As physicists we\nwould like to understand if there are some general principles that govern the\nstructure and dynamics of the neural circuits that underlie these phenomena. At\nthe molecular level there is an extraordinary universality, but these\nmechanisms are surprisingly complex. This raises the question of how the brain\nselects from these diverse mechanisms and adapts to compute \"the right thing\"\nin each context. One approach is to ask what problems the brain really solves.\nThere are several examples - from the ability of the visual system to count\nphotons on a dark night to our gestalt recognition of statistical tendencies\ntoward symmetry in random patterns - where the performance of the system in\nfact approaches some fundamental physical or statistical limits. This suggests\nthat some sort of optimization principles may be at work, and there are\nexamples where these principles have been formulated clearly and generated\npredictions which are confirmed in new experiments; a central theme in this\nwork is the matching of the coding and computational strategies of the brain to\nthe statistical structure of the world around us. Extension of these principles\nto the problem of learning leads us into interesting theoretical questions\nabout how to measure the complexity of the data from which we learn and the\ncomplexity of the models that we use in learning, as well as opening some new\nopportunities for experiment. This combination of theoretical and experimental\nwork gives us some new (if still speculative) perspectives on classical\nproblems and controversies in cognition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 May 2002 14:21:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Jul 2002 03:50:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Submitted","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"quant-ph gr-qc hep-th","license":null,"abstract":"  The elements of a deterministic quantum theory are developed, which\nreformulates and extends standard quantum theory. The proposed theory is\n`realistic' in the sense that in it, a general M-level quantum state is\nrepresented by a single real number r. Surprising as it may seem, this real\nnumber is shown to contain the same probabilistic information as the standard\nHilbert-space state, plus additional information from which measurement outcome\nis determined. A crucial concept in achieving this is that of Borelian\n(number-theoretic) normality. The essential role of complex numbers in standard\nquantum theory is subsumed by the action of a set of self-similar permutation\noperators on the digits and places of the base-M expansion of a base-M\nBorelian-normal r; these permutation operators are shown to have complex\nstructure and leave invariant the normality of the underlying real number. The\nset of real numbers generated by these permutations defines not only the\nHilbert space of standard quantum theory, but also, in addition, the sample\nspace from which quantum measurement outcomes can be objectively determined.\nDynamical real-number state reduction is precisely described by deterministic\nnumber-theoretic operators that reduce the degree of normality of r; from the\ndegree of normality one can infer the standard quantum-theoretic trace rule for\nmeasurement probability. All the foundational difficulties of standard quantum\ntheory are described in terms of the proposed theory. It is shown that the\nreal-number states of the proposed theory are precisely its beables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 May 2002 12:45:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
