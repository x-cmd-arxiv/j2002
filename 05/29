This leads to interesting issues because what, if any,\ninformation should be elicited from an agent depends on what other agents have\nrevealed about their preferences so far.\n  In this paper we study effective elicitation, and its impediments, for the\nmost common voting protocols.

This leads to an evolutionary picture of the Multiverse, where\nuniverses with more black holes have more descendants.

The hospitality for life of our universe is seen as an offshot of this\nself-organized process. - This paper outlines Smolin's hypothesis, its\nstrength, weakness and limits, its relationship to the anthropic principle and\nevolutionary biology, and comments on the hypothesis from different points of\nview: physics, biology, philosophy of science, philosophy of nature, and\nmetaphysics. Some of the main points are: (1) There is no necessary connection\nbetween black holes and life. In principle, life and Cosmological Natural\nSelection could be independent of each other. Smolin might explain the\nso-called fine-tuning of physical constants, but life remains an epiphenomenon.\n(2) The Darwinian analogy is an inadequate model transfer.

We show that the\ndesign of the optimal detector can be formulated as a semidefinite programming\nproblem. Based on this formulation, we derive a set of necessary and sufficient\nconditions for an optimal quantum measurement. We then show that the optimal\nmeasurement can be found by solving a standard (convex) semidefinite program\nfollowed by the solution of a set of linear equations or, at worst, a standard\nlinear programming problem. By exploiting the many well-known algorithms for\nsolving semidefinite programs, which are guaranteed to converge to the global\noptimum, the optimal measurement can be computed very efficiently in polynomial\ntime.\n  Using the semidefinite programming formulation, we also show that the rank of\neach optimal measurement operator is no larger than the rank of the\ncorresponding density operator. In particular, if the quantum state ensemble is\na pure-state ensemble consisting of (not necessarily independent) rank-one\ndensity operators, then we show that the optimal measurement is a pure-state\nmeasurement consisting of rank-one measurement operators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 May 2002 22:03:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}
