In\nPaper I and Paper II, we investigated the effects of dust absorption; here we\nextend our modelling in order to include the effects of scattering. We describe\nhow kinematical information can be combined with the radiative transfer\nequation, and present a Monte Carlo code that can handle kinematical\ninformation in an elegant way.\n  Compared to the case where only absorption is taken into account, we find\nthat dust attenuation considerably affects the observed kinematics when\nscattering is included. For the central lines of sight, dust can either\ndecrease or increase the central observed velocity dispersion. The most\nimportant effect of dust attenuation, however, is found at large projected\nradii. The kinematics at these lines of sight are strongly affected by photons\nscattered into these lines of sight, which were emitted by high-velocity stars\nin the central regions of the galaxy. These photons bias the LOSVDs towards\nhigh line-of-sight velocities, and significantly increase the observed velocity\ndispersion and LOSVD shape parameters. These effects are similar to the\nexpected kinematical signature of a dark matter halo, such that dust\nattenuation may form an alternative explanation for the usual stellar\nkinematical evidence for dark matter halos around elliptical galaxies.\n  We apply our results to discuss several other topics in galactic dynamics,\nwhere we feel dust attenuation should be taken into account. In particular, we\nargue that the kinematics observed at various wavelengths can help to constrain\nthe spatial distribution of dust in elliptical galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 May 2002 16:22:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The two-point correlation function\nof QSOs averaged over the entire survey (<z>~1.5) is found to be similar to\nthat of local galaxies. When sub-dividing the sample as a function of redshift,\nwe find that for an Einstein-de Sitter universe QSO clustering is constant (in\ncomoving coordinates) over the entire redshift range probed by the 2QZ, while\nin a universe with Omega_0=0.3 and Lambda_0=0.7 there is a marginal increase in\nclustering with redshift. Sub-dividing the 2QZ on the basis of apparent\nmagnitude we find only a slight difference between the clustering of QSOs of\ndifferent apparent brightness, with the brightest QSOs having marginally\nstronger clustering. We have made a first measurement of the redshift space\ndistortion of QSO clustering, with the goal of determining the value of\ncosmological parameters (in partcular Lambda_0) from geometric distortions. The\ncurrent data do not allow us to discriminate between models, however, in\ncombination with constraints from the evolution of mass clustering we find\nOmega_0=1-Lambda_0=0.23 +0.44-0.13 and beta(z~1.4)=0.39 +0.18-0.17.

The velocity field of the ionized gas shows gradual gradients\nwithin components but large jumps between components, with no obvious global\norganization. The HST [O III] image shows radial linear features on the east\nside of the QSO that appear to mark the edges of an ionization cone.\nConcentrating on the bright emission peaks ~4\\arcsec$ east of the quasar, we\nfind through modeling that we require at least two density regimes contributing\nsignificantly to the observed emission-line spectrum: one with a density of ~2\ncm^-3, having essentially unity filling factor, and one with a density of ~500\ncm^-3, having a very small (~10^-5) filling factor. Because the temperatures of\nthese two components are similar, they cannot be in pressure equilibrium, and\nthere is no obvious source of confinement for the dense regions. We estimate\nthat the dense regions will dissipate on timescales <~10^4 years and therefore\nneed to be continuously regenerated, most likely by shocks. Because we know\nthat some QSOs, at least, begin their lives in conjunction with merger-driven\nmassive starbursts in their host galaxies, an attractive interpretation is that\nthe extended emission region comprises gas that has been expelled as a result\nof tidal forces during the merger and is now being shocked by the galactic\nsuperwind from the starburst. This picture is supported by the observed\ndistribution of the ionized gas, the presence of velocities ranging up to ~700\nkm s^{-1}, and the existence of at least two QSOs having similarly luminous and\ncomplex extended emission regions that are known to have ultra-luminous IR\ngalaxy hosts with current or recent starbursts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 May 2002 02:04:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Our\nmodel includes ambipolar diffusion and magnetic braking and allows us to\nexamine the full range of expected behaviors and their dependence on the\nphysical parameters. For typical parameter values, the inflow first passes\nthrough an ambipolar-diffusion shock (at a radius r_a, where the magnetic flux\ndecouples from the matter), and later through a centrifugal shock at r=r_c, the\nouter edge of a rotationally supported disk of mass M_d.

First, I\npresent supplementary evidence that MACHO field 104 located at (l,b) =\n(3.11,-3.01) is anomalous in terms of the event duration distribution. I argue\nthat both the event durations and the very high optical depth of field 104 are\nnot representative and, therefore, exclude this field as an outlier. In\naddition, I eliminate field 159 at (l,b) = (6.35,-4.40) based mainly on its\nseparate location, but also on unexplained statistical properties of the event\ndurations. The remaining six DIA fields form a very homogeneous and spatially\ncompact set that is very suitable for averaging. The weighting of the optical\ndepth values for these six DIA fields results in a total optical depth\ntau_{tot} = 2.01^{+0.34}_{-0.32} x 10^{-6} at (l,b) = (2.22,-3.18). If a\nfraction of all sources, f_{disk}, assumed to be in the disk, does not\ncontribute to microlensing, then the optical depth toward the sources in the\nbar is tau_{bar} = 2.23^{+0.38}_{-0.35} x 10^{-6} 0.9/(1-f_{disk}). Both\ntau_{tot} and tau_{bar} are substantially lower than the original estimates of\nAlcock et al. Most of the change in the DIA-based optical depths comes from a\nmore appropriate statistical treatment of the results in individual fields and\nnot from the removal of fields 104 and 159. When taken together with tau_{bar}\n= (1.4 +/- 0.3) x 10^{-6} at (l,b) = (3.9,-3.8) as derived from clump giants,\nthis new result suggests that the conclusions from microlensing experiments are\nin reasonable agreement with the expectations from infrared-based Galactic\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 May 2002 13:16:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The empirical description adopted for the\ndirect continuum is the commonly used power law with an exponential cut-off.\nThe most direct test of the theoretical predictions, namely that the equivalent\nwidth of the line, Walpha, and the strength R of the reflection relative to the\ndirect continuum are closely related to each other, gives a substantially\npositive result, that is their mean ratio is very close to expectation, and\nonly a modest spread in the iron abundance seems implied.
