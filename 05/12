When\ncalculating the magnetic helicity balance we take into account the\nredistribution of the small-scale and large-scale magnetic fields between the\nmagnetic helicities, as well as magnetic helicity transport and diffusion due\nto small-scale turbulence. We demonstrate that the magnetic helicity flux\nthrough the galactic disc boundaries leads to a steady-state magnetic field\nwith magnetic energy comparable to the equipartition energy of the turbulent\nmotions of the interstellar medium. If such flux is ignored, the steady-state\nmagnetic field is found to be much smaller than the equipartition field. The\ntotal magnetic helicity flux through the boundaries consists of both an\nadvective flux and a diffusive flux. The exact ratio of these contributions\nseems not to be crucial for determining the strength of the steady-state\nmagnetic field and its structure. However at least some diffusive contribution\nis needed to smooth the magnetic helicity profile near to the disc boundaries.\nThe roles of various transport coefficients for magnetic helicity are\ninvestigated, and the values which lead to magnetic field configurations\ncomparable with those observed are determined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 May 2002 15:08:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The\ndischarge voltage determines the structure of the anode sheath and thus\ndetermines electron and ion velocities at the anode. These parameters appear to\nbe sufficient for constructing a solution with given temperature profile. It is\nshown that a good correlation between simulated and experimental results can be\nachieved by selecting an appropriate electron mobility and temperature profile.\nThe structure of the electrode sheath was studied theoretically over a wide\nrange of input parameters, such as discharge voltage, incoming neutral velocity\nand channel length, and the possibility of realization of the no-sheath\noperating regime is discussed here.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 May 2002 20:49:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In the\nclassical description, this peculiar diffusion is due to the onset of a weak\nchaos in a narrow stochastic layer near the separatrix of the coupling\nresonance. We have found that global dependence of the quantum diffusion\ncoefficient on model parameters mimics, to some extent, the classical data.\nHowever, the quantum diffusion happens to be slower that the classical one.\nAnother result is the dynamical localization that leads to a saturation of the\ndiffusion after some characteristic time. We show that this effect has the same\nnature as for the studied earlier dynamical localization in the presence of\nglobal chaos. The quantum Arnol'd diffusion represents a new type of quantum\ndynamics and can be observed, for example, in 2D semiconductor structures\n(quantum billiards) perturbed by time-periodic external fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 May 2002 01:06:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
