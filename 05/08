My finding\nthroughout this meeting has been that it is amazing how our knowledge of\ncosmological parameters has improved during the last years. It comes as a\nsurprise to many, that the simplest inflationary model of adiabatic\nperturbations agrees well with present data. But it is frustrating that we have\nnot made any progress in identifying the dark matter, in contrary, we have\nsupplemented it by what we call the 'dark energy', a gravitationally and\nesthetically repulsive component which is even more mysterious than the dark\nmatter. We have no understanding about the origin of these two most abundant\nenergy components of the present Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 May 2002 16:09:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In semiconductors, where no carriers are present, the only\npossible excitations are those of the localized impurity electrons (or holes)\nthemselves. Thus a possible interaction is closely related to superexchange. We\nfind an oscillating anti-ferromagnetic spin-spin coupling due to impurity\nelectron (hole) excitations. By treating the coupling through empty bands\n(superexchange) along the same route as carrier mediated interactions (RKKY) it\nis easy to compare these two kinds of spin-spin coupling. The interaction\nderived here is of special interest for diluted magnetic semiconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 May 2002 13:33:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

Translations along the secondary time\ndimension produce the electromagnetic gauge transformations of Kaluza--Klein\ntheory and the metric gauge transformations of Weyl theory, related as Weyl\npostulated. Geometrically, this phenomenon resides in an exponential-expansion\nproducing ``conformality constraint'', which replaces Kaluza's ``cylinder\ncondition''. The curvature tensors exhibit a wealth of ``interactions'' among\ngeometrical entities with physical interpretations. Unique to the conformally\nconstrained geometry is a sectionally isotropic, ultralocally determined\n``residual curvature'', useful in construction of an action density for field\nequations. A space-time--time geodesic describes a test particle whose rest\nmass m and electric charge q evolve according to definite laws. The particls's\nmotion is governed by four apparent forces: the Einstein gravitational force,\nthe Lorentz electromagnetic force, a force proportional to the electromagnetic\npotential, and a force proportional to a gradient d(ln phi), where the scalar\nfield phi is essentially the space-time--time residual radius of curvature. The\nparticle appears suddenly at an event E1 with q = -phi(E1) and vanishes at an\nevent E2 with q = phi(E2). At E1 and E2 the phi-force infinitely dominates the\nothers, causing E1 and E2 to tend to occur near where phi has an extreme value;\napplication to the modeling of orbital transitions of atomic electrons suggests\nitself. The equivalence of a test particle's inertial mass and its passive\ngravitational mass follows from the gravitational force's proportionality to m.\nNo connection is apparent between m and active gravitational mass or between q\nand active electric charge, nor does the theory seem to require any.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 May 2002 01:51:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
