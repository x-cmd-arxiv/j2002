The first\none is a modification and improvement of a model by Del Popolo & Gambera(1999),\nnamely based upon a modification of the top-hat model in order to take account\nof angular momentum acquisition by protostructures and of an external pressure\nterm in the virial theorem. The second one is based on the merging-halo\nformalism of Lacey & Cole (1993), accounting for the fact that massive clusters\naccrete matter quasi-continuously, and is an improvement of a model proposed by\nVoit (2000). The final result is that, in both models, the M-T relation shows a\nbreak at T \\sim 3-4 keV. The behavior of the M-T relation is as usual, M\n\\propto T^{3/2}, at the high mass end, and M \\propto T^{\\gamma}, with a value\nof \\gamma>3/2 depending on the chosen cosmology. The evolution of the M-T\nrelation, for a given M_{\\rm vir}, is more modest both in flat and open\nuniverses in comparison to previous estimate found in literature, even more\nmodest than what found by V2000. Moreover the time evolution is more rapid in\nmodels with L=0 than in models in which the angular momentum acquisition by\nprotostructures is taken into account (L \\neq 0). The effect of a non-zero\ncosmological constant is that of slightly increasing the evolution of the M-T\nrelation with respect to open models with L \\neq 0. The evolution is more rapid\nfor larger values (in absolute value) of the spectral index, n. The comparison\nof the mass-temperature relation with the data by Finoguenov, Reiprich &\nBohringer (2001), shows that the FRB data is able to rule out very low Omega_0\nmodels (<0.3), particularly in the open case, and that better fit are obtained\nby LambdaCDM models and by CDM models with Omega_0>0.3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 May 2002 19:44:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The continuum modelling is used to constrain the\ntemperature and density distributions in the envelope, enabling quantitative\nestimates of various molecular abundances. The molecular excitation analysis\nreveals that the emission from some molecular species is well reproduced\nassuming a constant fractional abundance throughout the envelope. The\nabundances and isotope ratios are generally close to typical values found in\ncold molecular clouds in these cases, and there is a high degree of deuterium\nfractionation. There are, however, a number of notable exceptions.

The location at\nwhich this increase occurs is consistent with the radius at which ices are\nexpected to thermally evaporate off the grains. In all, there is strong\nevidence for the presence of a `hot core' close to the protostar, whose\nphysical properties are similar to those detected towards most high mass\nprotostars except for a scaling factor. However, the small scale of the hot gas\nand the infalling nature of the envelope lead to very different chemical time\nscales between low mass and high mass hot cores, such that only very rapidly\nproduced second-generation complex molecules can be formed in IRAS 16293-2422.\nAlternatively, the ices may be liberated due to grain-grain collisions in\nturbulent shear zones where the outflow interacts with the envelope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 May 2002 11:49:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Jun 2002 09:55:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The\nvariational principle is a powerful tool for generating accurate estimates of\norbital parameters for neutron stars in quasi-equilibrium orbits. The second\npart of the thesis details the numerical application of the variational\nprinciple by solving the initial value problem for binary black holes in quasi-\nequilibrium circular orbits. The analysis draws from the novel ``puncture''\nmethod of describing the black holes, and relies on nonlinear adaptive\nmultigrid techniques for generating numerical results. We arrive at two\nimportant conclusions. First, the analytical variational principle describing\nbinary neutron stars in irrotational motion provides a road map for future\nnumerical simulations, and also lends credence to previous simulations by other\nauthors. Second, the numerical application and description of binary black\nholes in quasi-equilibrium circular orbits simplifies the analyses of previous\nauthors, and allows for the imposition of realistic boundary data in\nsimulations with relatively high grid densities.

The entity that we want to\ndescribe does not necessarily have to be a physical entity, but can also be an\nentity of a more abstract nature, for example a concept, or a cultural\nartifact, or the mind of a person, etc..., which means that we aim at very\ngeneral description. The effect that a context has on the state of the entity\nplays a fundamental role, which means that our approach is intrinsically\ncontextual. The approach is inspired by the mathematical formalisms that have\nbeen developed in axiomatic quantum mechanics, where a specific type of quantum\ncontextuality is modelled. However, because in general states also influence\ncontext -- which is not the case in quantum mechanics -- we need a more general\nsetting than the one used there. Our focus on context as a fundamental concept\nmakes it possible to unify `dynamical change' and `change under influence of\nmeasurement', which makes our approach also more general and more powerful than\nthe traditional quantum axiomatic approaches. For this reason an experiment (or\nmeasurement) is introduced as a specific kind of context. Mathematically we\nintroduce a state context property system as the structure to describe an\nentity by means of its states, contexts and properties. We also strive from the\nstart to a categorical setting and derive the morphisms between state context\nproperty systems from a merological covariance principle.
