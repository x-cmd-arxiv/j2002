Other groups have postulated that the unusually long spin periods\nassociated with AXPs could, instead, be due to accretion. As there are severe\nobservational constraints on any binary accretion model, fossil disk models\nhave been suggested as a plausible alternative. Here we analyze fossil disk\nmodels of AXPs in some detail, and point out some of their inherent\ninconsistencies. For example, we find that, unless it has an exceptionally high\nmagnetic field strength, a neutron star in a fossil disk cannot be observed as\nan AXP if the disk opacity is dominated by Kramers' law. However, standard\nalpha-disk models show that a Kramers opacity must dominate for the case log B\n> 12, making it unlikely that a fossil disk scenario can successfully produce\nAXPs. Additionally, we find that in order to sufficiently spin down a neutron\nstar in a fossil disk, an unusually efficient propeller torque must be used.\nSuch torques are inconsistent with observations of other accreting sytems -\nparticularly High Mass X-ray Binaries.

If only about half of\nthe energy is dissipated in the disk (with the other half dissipated in the\ncorona and carried away by the outflow) the outburst amplitude and duration are\nconsistent with observations of the microquasar GRS 1915+105. Viscous evolution\nexplains in a natural way the lack of direct transitions from the state C to\nthe state B in color-color diagram of this source. Further reduction of the\nfraction of energy dissipated in the optically thick disk switches off the\noutbursts which may explain why they are not seen in all high accretion rate\nsources being in the Very High State.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 May 2002 10:50:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We\nobtain a necessary and sufficient condition for perfect retrodiction of the\noutcome of a known generalised measurement, given the final state, for an\narbitrary initial state. From this, we deduce that, when the input and output\nHilbert spaces have equal (finite) dimension, it is impossible to perfectly\nretrodict the outcome of any fine-grained measurement (where each POVM element\ncorresponds to a single Kraus operator) for all initial states unless the\nmeasurement is unitarily equivalent to a projective measurement. It also\nenables us to show that every POVM can be realised in such a way that perfect\noutcome retrodiction is possible for an arbitrary initial state when the number\nof outcomes does not exceed the output Hilbert space dimension. We then\nconsider the situation where the initial state is not arbitrary, though it may\nbe entangled, and describe the conditions under which unambiguous outcome\nretrodiction is possible for a fine-grained generalised measurement. We find\nthat this is possible for some state if the Kraus operators are linearly\nindependent. This condition is also necessary when the Kraus operators are\nnon-singular. From this, we deduce that every trace-preserving quantum\noperation is associated with a generalised measurement whose outcome is\nunambiguously retrodictable for some initial state, and also that a set of\nunitary operators can be unambiguously discriminated iff they are linearly\nindependent. We then examine the issue of unambiguous outcome retrodiction\nwithout entanglement. This has important connections with the theory of locally\nlinearly dependent and locally linearly independent operators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 May 2002 13:30:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2002 10:44:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2002 10:16:09 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 1 Nov 2002 14:29:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}
