The complex resembles a circular bubble 600 pc in\ndiameter with a young super star cluster (SSC) near the center. The kinematics\nof ionized gas is studied through Ha emission with several slit positions.\nPosition-velocity diagrams show two distinct features with high speed motions.\nOne is an irregularly shaped region to the east of the SSC, 270 pc in size, in\nwhich most of the Ha emission is blue shifted by 120 km/s, and another is a 350\npc shell centered on the SSC with positive and negative velocity shifts of 60\nkm/s. Balmer and HeI absorption lines in the SSC give an age of 12-13 Myr,\nwhich is consistent with the photometric age but significantly older than the\nkinematic ages of the high speed regions. The energetics of the SSC and its\ninteraction with the environment are considered. The expansion energies exceed\n10^52 ergs, but the power outputs from winds and supernova in the SSC are large\nenough to account for this. The intensities of Balmer, [NII], and [SII]\nemission lines within and around the complex indicate that shock excitation\nmakes a significant contribution to the emission from the most energetic\nregion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 May 2002 12:30:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The final focus magnets of the interaction\nregions (IR) of circular colliders often have some specialized properties that\nmake it difficult to perform conventional beam based alignment procedures. At\nthe HERA interaction points, for example, these properties are: (a) The\nquadrupoles are quite strong and long. Therefore a thin lens approximation is\nquite imprecise. (b) The effects of angular magnet offsets become significant.\n(c) The possibilities to steer the beam are limited as long as the alignment is\nnot within specifications.
