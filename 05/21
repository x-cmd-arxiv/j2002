The full\nlight curve consists of 26655 individual points obtained between 1901 and 2001.\nThe light curve and its periodicity were analysed with help of the O-C diagram,\nFourier analysis and time-frequency analysis. The results demonstrate the\nlimitations of these linear methods. The next step was to investigate the\npossible presence of low-dimensional chaos in the light curve. For this, a\nsmoothed and noise-filtered signal was created from the averaged data and with\nhelp of time delay embedding, we have tried to reconstruct the attractor of the\nsystem. The main result is that R Cygni shows such period-doubling events that\ncan be interpreted as caused by a repetitive bifurcation of the chaotic\nattractor between a period 2T orbit and chaos. The switch between these two\nstates occurs in a certain compact region of the phase space, where the light\ncurve is characterized by ~1500-days long transients. The Lyapunov spectrum was\ncomputed for various embedding parameters confirming the chaotic attractor,\nalthough the exponents suffer from quite high uncertainty because of the\napplied approximation. Finally, the light curve is compared with a simple one\nzone model generated by a third-order differential equation which exhibits\nwell-expressed period-doubling bifurcation. The strong resemblance is another\nargument for chaotic behaviour. Further studies should address the problem of\nglobal flow reconstruction, including the determination of the accurate\nLyapunov exponents and dimension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 May 2002 19:45:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We\npresent here a new synthesis of the old and new data. We show that the Bochum\nevent, presumably a clump of $^{56}$Ni, and the late-time image, the locus of\nexcitation by $^{44}$Ti, are most naturally accounted for by sharing a common\nposition angle of about 14\\degree, the same as the mystery spot and early\nspeckle data on the ejecta, and that they are both oriented along the axis of\nthe inner circumstellar ring at 45\\degree to the plane of the sky. We also\ndemonstrate that the polarization represents a prolate geometry with the same\nposition angle and axis as the early speckle data and the late-time image and\nhence that the geometry has been fixed in time and throughout the ejecta. The\nBochum event and the Doppler kinematics of the [Ca II]/[O II] emission in\nspatially resolved HST spectra of the ejecta can be consistently integrated\ninto this geometry. The radioactive clump is deduced to fall approximately\nalong the axis of the inner circumstellar ring and therefore to be redshifted\nin the North whereas the [Ca II]/[O II] 7300 \\AA emission is redshifted in the\nSouth.
