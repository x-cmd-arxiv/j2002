The pulsations are\ndetected during an 800 s interval spanning the flux maximum of the burst.\nWithin this interval the barycentric oscillation frequency increases in a\nmonotonic fashion from 581.89 to 581.93 Hz. The predicted orbital motion of the\nneutron star during this interval is consistent with such an increase as long\nas optical maximum corresponds roughly with superior conjunction of V801 Arae,\nthe optical companion to the neutron star in 4U 1636-53. We show that a range\nof circular orbits with velocity 90 < v sin i < 175 km/s and fractional phase\n0.336 > p > 0.277 for the neutron star can provide an excellent description of\nthe frequency and phase evolution. The average pulse profile is sinusoidal and\nthe time averaged pulsation amplitude, as inferred from the half amplitude of\nthe sinusoid is 1%, smaller than typical for burst oscillations observed in\nnormal thermonuclear bursts. We do not detect any higher harmonics nor the\nputative subharmonic near 290 Hz. The 90% upper limits on signal amplitude at\nthe subharmonic and first harmonic are 0.1% and 0.06%, respectively. The\ncoherent pulsation provides compelling evidence for a rapidly rotating neutron\nstar in 4U 1636-53, and further supports the connection of burst oscillation\nfrequencies with the spin frequencies of neutron stars. Our results provide\nfurther evidence that some millisecond pulsars are spun up via accretion in\nLMXBs. We also discuss the implications of our orbital velocity constraint for\nthe masses of the components of 4U 1636-53.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 May 2002 16:06:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

We calculate the relevant\nform factors within a relativistic constituent quark model, for the first time\nwithout employing the impulse approximation. The calculated form factors are\nused to evaluate differential decay rates and polarization observables. We\npresent results on the q2-dependence of a set of observables with and without\nlong-distance contributions. A similar analysis is done for the exclusive rare\ndecays B_c -> D (D*) l(bar) l with special emphasis on the cascade decay B_c ->\nD* (-> D pi) l(bar) l. We derive a four-fold angular decay distribution for\nthis process in terms of helicity amplitudes including lepton mass effects. The\nfour-fold angular decay distribution allows to define a number of physical\nobservables which are amenable to measurement. We compare our results with the\nresults of other studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 May 2002 18:51:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2002 13:45:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2005 10:57:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2005 06:21:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-23"}

For a given value of theta, we construct local scale\ntransformations which can be viewed as scale transformations with a\nspace-time-dependent dilatation factor. Two distinct types of local scale\ntransformations are found. The first type may describe strongly anisotropic\nscaling of static systems with a given value of theta, whereas the second type\nmay describe dynamical scaling with a dynamical exponent z. Local scale\ntransformations act as a dynamical symmetry group of certain non-local\nfree-field theories. Known special cases of local scale invariance are\nconformal invariance for theta=1 and Schrodinger invariance for theta=2. The\nhypothesis of local scale invariance implies that two-point functions of\nquasiprimary operators satisfy certain linear fractional differential\nequations, which are constructed from commuting fractional derivatives.

The forward problem in acoustics consists of\nfinding the sound pressure levels at various detectors resulting from sound\nsignals emanating from the active acoustic sources. The inverse problem\nconsists of using the sound recorded by the detectors to separate the signals\nand recover the original source waveforms. In general, the inverse problem is\nunsolvable without additional information. This general problem is called\nsource separation, and several techniques have been developed that utilize\nmaximum entropy, minimum mutual information, and maximum likelihood. In\nprevious work, it has been demonstrated that these techniques can be recast in\na Bayesian framework. This paper demonstrates the power of the Bayesian\napproach, which provides a natural means for incorporating prior information\ninto a source model. An algorithm is developed that utilizes information\nregarding both the statistics of the amplitudes of the signals emitted by the\nsources and the relative locations of the detectors. Using this prior\ninformation, the algorithm finds the most probable source behavior and\nconfiguration. Thus, the inverse problem can be solved by simultaneously\nperforming source separation and localization. It should be noted that this\nalgorithm is not designed to account for delay times that are often important\nin acoustic source separation.
