Because convection strives to establish an entropy gradient that\nrises with radius, the observable properties of a relaxed cluster depend\nentirely on its dark-matter potential and the entropy distribution of its\nuncondensed gas. Guided by simulations, we compute the intracluster entropy\ndistribution that arises in the absence of radiative cooling and supernova\nheating by assuming that the gas-density distribution would be identical to\nthat of the dark matter. The lowest-entropy gas would then fall below a\ncritical entropy threshold at which the cooling time equals a Hubble time.\nRadiative cooling and whatever feedback is associated with it must modify the\nentropy of that low-entropy gas, changing the overall entropy distribution\nfunction and thereby altering the observable properties of the cluster. Using\nsome phenomenological prescriptions for entropy modification based on the\nexistence of this cooling threshold, we construct a remarkably realistic set of\ncluster models. The surface-brightness profiles, mass-temperature relation, and\nluminosity-temperature relation of observed clusters all naturally emerge from\nthese models. By introducing a single adjustable parameter related to the\namount of intracluster gas that can cool within a Hubble time, we can also\nreproduce the observed temperature gradients of clusters and the deviations of\ncooling-flow clusters from the standard luminosity-temperature relation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 May 2002 00:47:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We report HST/STIS spatially resolved spectroscopy of IRC +10420\nand its reflection nebula with some surprising results. Long slit spectroscopy\nof the reflected spectrum allows us to effectively view the star from different\ndirections. Measurements of the double--peaked Halpha emission profile show a\nuniform outflow of gas in a nearly spherical distribution, contrary to previous\nmodels with an equatorial disk or bipolar outflow.

The theory\nassumes that in the depletion layer the nonequilibrium chemical potentials of\nspin up and spin down carriers are constant and carrier recombination and spin\nrelaxation are inhibited. Under the general conditions of an applied bias and\nexternally injected (source) spin, the model formulates analytically carrier\nand spin transport in magnetic p-n junctions at low bias. The evaluation of the\ncarrier and spin densities at the depletion layer establishes the necessary\nboundary conditions for solving the diffusive transport equations in the bulk\nregions separately, thus greatly simplifying the problem. The carrier and spin\ndensity and current profiles in the bulk regions are calculated and the I-V\ncharacteristics of the junction are obtained. It is demonstrated that spin\ninjection through the depletion layer of a magnetic p-n junction is not\npossible unless nonequilibrium spin accumulates in the bulk regions--either by\nexternal spin injection or by the application of a large bias. Implications of\nthe theory for majority spin injection across the depletion layer, minority\nspin pumping and spin amplification, giant magnetoresistance, spin-voltaic\neffect, biasing electrode spin injection, and magnetic drift in the bulk\nregions are discussed in details, and illustrated using the example of a GaAs\nbased magnetic p-n junction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 May 2002 10:54:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Instances of the framework can be\napplied to an untagged, unstructured corpus of natural language sentences,\nresulting in a labelled, bracketed version of that corpus.\n  Firstly, the framework aligns all sentences in the corpus in pairs, resulting\nin a partition of the sentences consisting of parts of the sentences that are\nequal in both sentences and parts that are unequal. Unequal parts of sentences\ncan be seen as being substitutable for each other, since substituting one\nunequal part for the other results in another valid sentence. The unequal parts\nof the sentences are thus considered to be possible (possibly overlapping)\nconstituents, called hypotheses.\n  Secondly, the selection learning phase considers all hypotheses found by the\nalignment learning phase and selects the best of these. The hypotheses are\nselected based on the order in which they were found, or based on a\nprobabilistic function.\n  The framework can be extended with a grammar extraction phase. This extended\nframework is called parseABL. Instead of returning a structured version of the\nunstructured input corpus, like the ABL system, this system also returns a\nstochastic context-free or tree substitution grammar.\n  Different instances of the framework have been tested on the English ATIS\ncorpus, the Dutch OVIS corpus and the Wall Street Journal corpus.
