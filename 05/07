We\nhave performed an HI and optical study of this nearly face-on galaxy.

The inner ring is faint, and the outer ring is a rather ill-defined\npseudoring. Furthermore, the size ratio of the rings is such that they cannot\nbe due to a single pattern speed linking them together.\n  The outer pseudoring is peculiar, since it lies in the faint outer parts of\nthe disk, where star formation is still going on at 1.4 times the optical\nradius. Higher HI column densities are associated with these regions and the\natomic gas layer is warped. These perturbations affect only the outer disk,\nsince the kinematics within the main body conforms well to an ordinary\ndifferentially rotating disk.\n  We propose here that both nuclear activity and star formation in the warped\nouter parts might be linked to the fact that NGC 3642 is located in a rich\nenvironment, where its close neighbors show clear signs of merging.

We compare the current\nhigh-resolution CMB data to models of dark energy characterized by an inverse\npower law or exponential potential and by the coupling to dark matter. We\ndetermine the curve of degeneracy between the dark energy equation of state and\nthe dimensionless Hubble parameter h and show that even an independent perfect\ndetermination of h may be insufficient to distinguish dark energy from a pure\ncosmological constant with the current dataset. On the other hand, we find that\nthe interaction with dark matter is firmly bounded, regardless of the\npotential. In terms of the dimensionless ratio \\beta of the dark energy\ninteraction to gravity, we find \\beta <0.16 (95% c.l.). This implies that the\neffective equation of state between equivalence and tracking has been close to\nthe pure matter equation of state within 1% and that scalar gravity is at least\n40 times weaker than tensor gravity.

We perform\nmeasurements of X-ray diffraction, dc magnetization, ESR, and electrical\nresistivity. These samples show at $T_C$ a paramagnetic (PM) to ferromagnetic\n(FM) transition, however, we found that for $n>0.50$ there is a coexistence of\nboth of these phases below $T_C$. On lowering $T$ below the charge-ordering\n(CO) temperature $T_{CO}$ all the samples exhibit a coexistence between the FM\nmetallic and CO (antiferromagnetic) phases. In the whole $T$ range the FM phase\nfraction ($X$) decreases with increasing $n$. Furthermore, we show that only\nfor $n\\leq 0.50$ the metallic fraction is above the critical percolation\nthreshold $X_C\\simeq 15.5%$. As a consequence, these samples show very\ndifferent magnetoresistance properties. In addition, for $n\\leq 0.50$ we\nobserve a percolative metal-insulator transition at $T_{MI}$, and for\n$T_{MI}<T<T_{CO}$ the insulating-like behavior generated by the enlargement of\n$X$ with increasing $T$ is well described by the percolation law $\\rho\n^{-1}=\\sigma \\sim (X-X_C)^t$, where $t$ is a critical exponent. On the basis of\nthe values obtained for this exponent we discuss different possible percolation\nmechanisms, and suggest that a more deep understanding of geometric and\ndimensionality effects is needed in phase separated manganites. We present a\ncomplete $T$ vs $n$ phase diagram showing the magnetic and electric properties\nof the studied compound around half doping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 May 2002 01:34:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

This seems, however, to be in contradiction with the\nfundamental role played by covariance matrices in finance, which constitute the\npillars of modern investment theory and have also gained industry-wide\napplications in risk management. Our paper is an attempt to resolve this\nembarrassing paradox. The key observation is that the effect of noise strongly\ndepends on the ratio r = n/T, where n is the size of the portfolio and T the\nlength of the available time series. On the basis of numerical experiments and\nanalytic results for some toy portfolio models we show that for relatively\nlarge values of r (e.g. 0.6) noise does, indeed, have the pronounced effect\nsuggested by [1,2,3] and illustrated later by [4,5] in a portfolio optimization\ncontext, while for smaller r (around 0.2 or below), the error due to noise\ndrops to acceptable levels. Since the length of available time series is for\nobvious reasons limited in any practical application, any bound imposed on the\nnoise-induced error translates into a bound on the size of the portfolio. In a\nrelated set of experiments we find that the effect of noise depends also on\nwhether the problem arises in asset allocation or in a risk measurement\ncontext: if covariance matrices are used simply for measuring the risk of\nportfolios with a fixed composition rather than as inputs to optimization, the\neffect of noise on the measured risk may become very small.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 May 2002 07:53:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 May 2002 17:22:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We assess the observability of this effect\nin the 1 PeV - 100 PeV energy range of kilometer-scale detectors with several\nnew points of emphasis that hinge on enhanced neutral current cross sections. A\nmajor point is the importance of ``feed-down'' regeneration of upward neutrino\nflux, driven by new-physics neutral current interactions in the flux evolution\nequations. Feed-down is far from negligible, and it is essential to include its\neffect. We then find that the angular distribution of events has high\ndiscriminating value in separating models. In particular the ``up-to-down''\nratio between upward and downward-moving neutrino fluxes is a practical\ndiagnostic tool which can discriminate between models in the near future. The\nslope of the angular distribution, in the region of maximum detected flux, is\nalso substantially different in low-scale gravity and the Standard Model.

In application to the space-time geometry the asymmetry of world\nfunction means that the past and the future are not equivalent geometrically.\nT-geometry is described in terms of finite point subspaces and world function\nbetween pairs of points of these subsets, i.e. in the language which is\nimmanent to geometry and free of external means of description (coordinates,\ncurves). Such a description appears to be simple and effective even in the case\nof complicated T-geometry. Antisymmetric component of the world function\ngenerates appearance of additional metric fields. This leads to appearance of\nthree sorts of Christoffel symbols and three sorts of geodesics. Three sorts of\nthe first order tubes (future, past and neutral) appear. If the fields\nconnected with the antisymmetric component are strong enough, the timelike\nfirst order tube has a finite length in the timelike direction. It was shown\nearler that the symmetric T-geometry explains non-relativistic quantum effects\nwithout a reference to principles of quantum mechanics. One should expect that\nnonsymmetric space-time T-geometry is also characteristic for microcosm, and it\nwill be useful in the elementary particle theory, because there is a series of\nunexpected associations. First order tubes are associated with world tubes of\nclosed strings. Antisymmetry is associated with supersymmetry. Three sorts of\ntubes are associated with three sorts of quarks. Limitation of the tube in time\ndirection is associated with confinement. At any rate, the space-time\nT-geometry with additional parameters has more capacities, than usual\nRiemannian geometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 May 2002 05:36:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 May 2002 09:14:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Analytical solution and its Schmidt decomposition are found and\napplied to evaluate how much the initially excited dots can be entangled to the\nremaining dots if all of them are initially disentangled. It is demonstrated\nthat the perfect maximally entangled states (MES) can only be generated in the\nsystems of up to 6 dots with a single dot initially excited. It is also shown\nthat highly entangled states, approximating the MES with a good accuracy, can\nstill be generated in systems of odd number of dots with almost half of them\nbeing excited. A sudden decrease of entanglement is observed by increasing the\ntotal number of dots in a system with a fixed number of excitations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 May 2002 11:00:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Dec 2002 23:42:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-03"}
