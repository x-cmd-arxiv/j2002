Firstly, using the experimental bounds on three body LFV\ndecays, the corresponding bounds on two body LFV decays are reviewed. The\ndynamical suppression of three body LFV decays due to momentum dependent\ncouplings is also reviewed. Secondly, the role of the LFV decays to explain the\nLSND excess is discussed in detail, for which the experimental bounds on three\nbody LFV decays, i.e. \\mu -> 3e are used to constraint the coupling\n\\tilde{g}_{Z_{\\mu e}}, which is needed to calculate the anomalous muon decay\n\\mu -> e\\nu_l\\bar{\\nu}_l. Then comparing the effective coupling of anomalous\nmuon decay to r>1.6\\times 10^{-3} [9809524], it is proved that LFV is not the\ncorrect hypothesis to explain the LSND excess. Finally, LFV decays at loop\norder are studied in Seesaw model of neutrino masses [PRL. 86 2502 (2001)]\nwhere the smallness of the Seesaw neutrino mass may be naturally realized with\nm_N (mass of right-handed singlet neutrinos) of order 1 TeV.
