The accretion disk itself is\ntaken to provide a set of fixed boundary conditions for the problem. The 3-D\nresults are consistent with the theory of steady, axisymmetric, centrifugally\ndriven disk winds up to the Alfv\\'en surface of the outflow. Beyond the\nAlfv\\'en surface however, the jet in 3-D becomes unstable to non-axisymmetric,\nKelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. We show that jets maintain their long-term\nstability through a self-limiting process wherein the average Alfv\\'enic Mach\nnumber within the jet is maintained to order unity. This is accomplished in at\nleast two ways. First, poloidal magnetic field is concentrated along the\ncentral axis of the jet forming a ``backbone'' in which the Alfv\\'en speed is\nsufficiently high to reduce the average jet Alfv\\'enic Mach number to unity.\nSecond, the onset of higher order Kelvin-Helmholtz ``flute'' modes (m \\ge 2)\nreduce the efficiency with which the jet material is accelerated, and transfer\nkinetic energy of the outflow into the stretched, poloidal field lines of the\ndistorted jet. This too has the effect of increasing the Alfv\\'en speed, and\nthus reducing the Alfv\\'enic Mach number. The jet is able to survive the onset\nof the more destructive m=1 mode in this way. Our simulations also show that\njets can acquire corkscrew, or wobbling types of geometries in this relatively\nstable end-state, depending on the nature of the perturbations upon them.\nFinally, we suggest that jets go into alternating periods of low and high\nactivity as the disappearance of unstable modes in the sub-Alfv\\'enic regime\nenables another cycle of acceleration to super-Alfv\\'enic speeds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 May 2002 17:47:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Consequently, HDF850.1 has become a test case of the possibility that\nthe most violently star-forming objects in the universe are too red and/or\ndistant to be seen in the deepest optical images. Here we report the discovery\nof the host galaxy of HDF850.1. This object has been revealed by careful\nanalysis of a new, deep K-prime image of the HDF obtained with the Subaru 8.2-m\ntelescope. Its reality is confirmed by a similar analysis of the HST NICMOS\nF160W image of the same region. This object is extremely faint (K=23.5), clumpy\n(on sub-arcsec scales) and very red (I-K > 5.2; H-K = 1.4 +- 0.35). The\nlikelihood that it is the correct identification is strongly reinforced by a\nreanalysis of the combined MERLIN+VLA 1.4-GHz map of the field which yields a\nnew radio detection of HDF850.1 only 0.1 arcsec from the new near-ir\ncounterpart, and with sufficient positional accuracy to exclude all previously\nconsidered alternative optical candidates.

In a recent Letter [Phys.\nRev. Lett. {\\bf 87}, 174501, (2001)] we exposed the crucial role played by a\nlocalized region where the energy of fluctuations is produced by interactions\nwith the mean flow (the \"critical layer\"). We showed that a layer of weakly\nspace-dependent viscosity placed near the critical layer can have a very large\nstabilizing effect on hydrodynamic fluctuations, retarding significantly the\nonset of turbulence. In this paper we extend these observation in two\ndirections: first we show that the strong stabilization of the primary\ninstability is also obtained when the viscosity profile is realistic (inferred\nfrom simulations of turbulent flows with a small concentration of polymers).\nSecond, we analyze the secondary instability (around the time-dependent primary\ninstability) and find similar strong stabilization. Since the secondary\ninstability develops around a time-dependent solution and is three-dimensional,\nthis brings us closer to the turbulent case. We reiterate that the large effect\nis {\\em not} due to a modified dissipation (as is assumed in some theories of\ndrag reduction), but due to reduced energy intake from the mean flow to the\nfluctuations. We propose that similar physics act in turbulent drag reduction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 May 2002 13:53:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
