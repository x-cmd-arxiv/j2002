Their spectra differ\nsignificantly from the canonical luminous AGNs, most notably by the absence of\nthe ``big blue bump''. In the present paper, taking a typical\nLLAGN--NGC4258--as an example, we investigate the origin of their spectral\nemission. The observational data of NGC4258 is extremely abundant, including\nwater maser emission, putting very strict constraints to its theoretical\nmodels. The infrared (IR) spectrum is well described by a steep power-law form\n$f_{\\nu}\\propto \\nu^{-1.4}$, and may extend to the optical/UV band.

The accretion disk\nis composed of an inner ADAF (or radiatively inefficient accretion flow) and an\nouter standard thin disk. A shock occurs when the accretion flow is ejected out\nof the ADAF to form the jet near the black hole, accelerating the electrons\ninto a power-law energy distribution. The synchrotron and self-Comptonized\nemission from these electrons greatly dominates over the underlying accretion\ndisk and can well explain the spectrum ranging from IR to X-ray bands. The\nfurther propagation of the shocked gas in the jet can explain the flat radio\nspectrum of NGC4258. Several predictions of our model are presented for testing\nagainst future observations, and we briefly discuss the application of the\nmodel to other LLAGNs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 May 2002 10:42:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Voting is a general method for\npreference aggregation, but seminal results have shown that all general voting\nprotocols are manipulable. One could try to avoid manipulation by using voting\nprotocols where determining a beneficial manipulation is hard. Especially among\ncomputational agents, it is reasonable to measure this hardness by\ncomputational complexity. Some earlier work has been done in this area, but it\nwas assumed that the number of voters and candidates is unbounded. We derive\nhardness results for practical multiagent settings where the number of\ncandidates is small but the number of voters can be large. We show that with\ncomplete information about the others' votes, individual manipulation is easy,\nand coalitional manipulation is easy with unweighted voters. However,\nconstructive coalitional manipulation with weighted voters is intractable for\nall of the voting protocols under study, except for the nonrandomized Cup.\nDestructive manipulation tends to be easier. Randomizing over instantiations of\nthe protocols (such as schedules of the Cup protocol) can be used to make\nmanipulation hard. Finally, we show that under weak assumptions, if weighted\ncoalitional manipulation with complete information about the others' votes is\nhard in some voting protocol, then individual and unweighted manipulation is\nhard when there is uncertainty about the others' votes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 May 2002 20:27:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}

In the model, we take into account the pairing correlation of\np-shell neutrons in 9Li, in addition to that of valence neutrons outside the\n9Li nucleus, and solve the coupled-channel two- and three-body problems of 10Li\nand 11Li, respectively. The results show that degrees of freedom of the pairing\ncorrelation in 9Li play an important role in the structure of 10Li and 11Li. In\n10Li, the pairing correlation in 9Li produces a so-called pairing-blocking\neffect due to the presence of valence neutron, which degenerates s- and p-wave\nneutron orbits energetically. In 11Li, on the other hand, the pairing-blocking\neffect is surpassed by the core-n interaction due to two degrees of freedom of\ntwo valence neutrons surrounding 9Li, and as a result, the ground state is\ndominated by the p-shell closed configuration and does not show a spatial\nextension with a large r.m.s. radius. These results indicate that the pairing\ncorrelation is realized differently in odd- and even-neutron systems of 10Li\nand 11Li. We further improve the tail part of the 9Li-n interaction, which\nworks well to reproduce the observed large r.m.s. radius in 11Li.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 May 2002 03:57:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
