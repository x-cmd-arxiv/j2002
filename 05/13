Due to the extreme Ly-alpha\nopacities of the neutral IGM, objects within this 'gray age' can only be\nobserved at wavelengths longer than about 1micron. We use the latest\nsimulations of the evolution of the IGM in the context of LambdaCDM structure\nformation models constrained by observations of the highest redshift QSOs to\npredict the optical depth as a function of frequency of the neutral IGM due to\nthe HI 21cm line. We then simulate radio spectra assuming observational\nparameters for future large area radio telescopes. These spectra show that HI\n21cm absorption studies could be a powerful probe of the rich structure of the\nneutral IGM prior to the epoch of reionization, including 1% absorption by the\nmean neutral IGM, plus deeper, narrow lines (5% and a few km/s). Most of the\nvariations in transmissivity are due to the mild density inhomogeneities with\ntypical values of the cosmic overdensity of about 10, precisely the structures\nthat at later times give rise to the Ly-alpha forest.

However, within models in which modifications of the bound\nnucleon structure functions are accounted for to describe the EMC effect in\nnuclei, we find that the nuclear effects may be canceled at a level of ~ 3 %\nonly, leading to an accuracy of ~ 12 % in the extraction of F2n / F2p at x ~\n0.7 - 0.8.
