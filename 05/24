Both HVCs have a small inner region where the neutral\nhydrogen column density N_HI decreases slowly and a larger outer region where\nN_HI declines more rapidly, smoothly and exponentially from ~ 2 X 10^19 atoms\ncm^-2 down to < 10^18 atoms cm^-2. Line widths, and presumably temperature and\nturbulence, do not increase in the outermost regions. Therefore pressure\ndecreases smoothly, making confinement by dark matter gravity more likely than\nconfinement by external pressure.\n  The more extended HVC, W491, has a superimposed small cloud (which we dub a\n``mini-HVC''), offset by 66 km s^-1 in velocity along the line of sight with\npeak column density about 5 X 10^18 atoms cm^-2. Preliminary data toward future\nmapping of two more HVCs reveals two more mini-HVCs of similarly small size and\ncentral column density a bit less than 1 X 10^19 atoms cm^-2. We suggest that\nthese three mini-HVCs are not physically associated with the HVCs on which they\nare superimposed, but are either very small outlyers of the extended Magellanic\nStream HVC complex or more distant and/or smaller isolated CHVCs.\n  The value of N_HI at the point where the neutral and ionized column densities\nare equal is ~ 2 X 10^19 atoms cm^-2 for the two mapped HVCs. Therefore the\nangular scalelength of the total hydrogen is appreciably larger than the\nobserved HI scalelength. Previous distance estimates, related to absolute size\nand mass of the total hydrogen cloud, may have to be scaled down because of the\nundetected, more extended ionized hydrogen.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 May 2002 16:12:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We show that nonlocal\nspin-entanglement in form of an effective Heisenberg spin interaction is\ninduced between electron spins residing on two quantum dots with no direct\ncoupling between them but each of them being tunnel-coupled to the same\nsuperconductor. We then discuss a nonequilibrium setup where mobile and\nnonlocal spin-entanglement can be created by coherent injection of two\nelectrons in an Andreev tunneling process into two spatially separated quantum\ndots and subsequently into two Fermi-liquid leads. The current for injecting\ntwo spin-entangled electrons into different leads shows a resonance whereas\ntunneling via the same dot into the same lead is suppressed by the Coulomb\nblockade effect of the quantum dots. The Aharonov-Bohm oscillations in the\ncurrent are shown to contain h/e and h/2e periods. Finally we discuss a\nstructure consisting of a superconductor weakly coupled to two separate\nLuttinger liquid leads. We show that strong correlations again suppress the\ncoherent subsequent tunneling of two electrons into the same lead, thus\ngenerating again nonlocal spin-entangled electrons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 May 2002 16:31:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Some of these\nreorderings can be considered coverings of the iteration space with sets having\nsmall surface-to-volume ratios. Use of such sets may reduce the number of cache\nmisses in computations of local operators having the iteration space as their\ndomain. First, we derive lower bounds on cache misses that any algorithm must\nsuffer while computing a local operator on a grid. Then, we explore coverings\nof iteration spaces of structured and unstructured discretization grid\noperators which allow us to approach these lower bounds. For structured grids\nwe introduce a covering by successive minima tiles based on the interference\nlattice of the grid. We show that the covering has a small surface-to-volume\nratio and present a computer experiment showing actual reduction of the cache\nmisses achieved by using these tiles. For planar unstructured grids we show\nexistence of a covering which reduces the number of cache misses to the level\nof that of structured grids. Next, we introduce a class of multidimensional\ngrids, called starry grids in this paper. These grids represent an abstraction\nof unstructured grids used in, for example, molecular simulations and the\nsolution of partial differential equations. We show that starry grids can be\ncovered by sets having a low surface-to-volume ratio and, hence have the same\ncache efficiency as structured grids. Finally, we present a triangulation of a\nthree-dimensional cube that has the property that any local operator on the\ncorresponding grid must incur a significantly larger number of cache misses\nthan a similar operator on a structured grid of the same size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 May 2002 00:56:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}

The topological degeneration of the BPS monopole manifests\nitself as the Gribov copies of the covariant Coulomb gauge in the form of the\ntime integral of the Gauss constraint. We also show that in the theory there is\na zero mode of the Gauss constraint leading to an electric monopole and an\nadditional mass of eta_0-meson in QCD. The consequences of the monopole vacuum\nin the form of a rising potential and topological confinement are studied in\nthe framework of the perturbation theory. An estimation of the vacuum\nexpectation value of the square of the magnetic tension is given through the\neta_0-meson mass, and arguments in favour of the stability of the monopole\nvacuum are considered. We also discuss why all these \"smiles\" of the Cheshire\ncat are kept by the Dirac fundamental quantization, but not the conventional\nFaddeev-Popov integral.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 May 2002 06:45:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Jun 2002 13:11:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 2 Sep 2002 12:32:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Recent studies have had\nspectacular success in understanding the nature of the excited states mainly\ndue to the extensive studies of the classical phase space structures and their\nbifurcations. Such detailed classical-quantum correspondence studies are\npresently limited to two or quasi two dimensional systems. One of the main\nreasons for such a constraint has to do with the problem of visualization of\nrelevant objects like surface of sections and Wigner or Husimi distributions\nassociated with an eigenstate.
