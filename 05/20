This\nensures that there is no sharp cut-off in anisotropy on arc-minute scales. As\nwe had pointed out earlier, tangled magnetic fields, if they exist, will then\nbe a potentially important contributor to small-angular scale CMBR\nanisotropies. Several ongoing and new experiments, are expected to probe the\nvery small angular scales, corresponding to multipoles with l>1000. In view of\nthis observational focus, we revisit the predicted signals due to primordial\ntangled magnetic fields, for different spectra and different cosmological\nparameters. We also identify a new regime, where the photon mean-free path\nexceeds the scale of the perturbation, which dominates the predicted signal at\nvery high l. A scale-invariant spectrum of tangled fields which redshifts to a\npresent value B_{0}=3\\times 10^{-9} Gauss, produces temperature anisotropies at\nthe 10 micro Kelvin level between l ~ 1000-3000. Larger signals result if the\nunivese is lambda dominated, if the baryon density is larger, or if the\nspectral index of magnetic tangles is steeper, n > -3. The signal will also\nhave non-Gaussian statistics. We predict the distinctive form of the increased\npower expected in the microwave background at high l in the presence of\nsignificant tangled magnetic fields. We may be on the verge of detecting or\nruling out the presence of tangled magnetic fields which are strong enough to\ninfluence the formation of large-scale structure in the Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 May 2002 15:18:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Once black holes are produced, they will\ngive us much information about TeV-scale new physics directly. But such black\nholes can also be used for the precision measurements of the Standard Model\n(SM). The SM is nothing but a theory which can describe weak-scale, and\nTeV-scale physics will affect it. So if some experimental results which cannot\nbe explained in the SM are found, they will be attributed to TeV-scale physics\nand we can obtain ``bottom-up'' type information about new physics. In this\npaper, we consider the precision measurements of the top sector at the LHC by\nusing black holes. The stringent trigger conditions to confirm the black hole\nproduction vanish almost all of the QCD background, and we can examine the top\nquark emitted from black holes very precisely. The error of the top quark mass\nand the top Yukawa coupling are drastically reduced, leading to a very accurate\ntest of the Higgs mechanism. We can directly measure the CKM matrix element\n|V_{ts}|, and we will understand the property of the CKM matrix and the origin\nof CP-violation deeply. The very precise measurements of such properties in the\nSM, enabled by black holes, can become treasures in the quest for TeV-scale\nphysics because there exists a possibility that TeV-scale physics affects them\nand destroys the predictions of the SM. By combining the direct information of\nnew physics obtained from black holes themselves and the indirect information\nobtained from the limitations of the SM, we will be able to identify TeV-scale\nphysics correctly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 May 2002 05:30:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Instead of considering the Langer correction for the centrifugal\nterm, the approach adopted here is that of Hainz and Grabert : The centrifugal\nterm is expanded perturbatively (in powers of $\\hbar$), decomposing it into 2\nterms -- the classical centrifugal potential and a quantum correction. Hainz\nand Grabert found that this method reproduced the exact energies of the\nhydrogen atom, to the first order in $\\hbar$, with all higher order corrections\nvanishing. In the present study, this formalism is extended to the case of\nradial potentials under hard wall confinement, to check whether the same\nargument holds good for such confined systems as well. As explicit examples, 3\nwidely known potentials are studied, which are of considerable importance in\nthe theoretical treatment of various atomic phenomena involving atomic\ntransitions, viz., the 3-dimensional harmonic oscillator, the hydrogen atom,\nand the Hulthen potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 May 2002 08:20:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 May 2003 10:23:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
