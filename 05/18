Thus vacuum dynamics can\nalways be absorbed in the (infinite number of) counterterm parameters\nnecessarily present in the effective lagrangian. These finite parameters, which\nat present must be fitted to data, encode the empirical vacuum physics as well\nas other short-range dynamics into the effective lagrangian; in practice, only\na small number of parameters must be fitted. The strength of the effective\nfield theory (EFT) framework is that there is no need to make a concrete\npicture of the vacuum dynamics, as one does in a renormalizable hadronic\ntheory. At the one-loop level, the most convenient renormalization scheme\nrequires explicit sums over long-range (``valence'') nucleon orbitals only,\nthus explaining the so-called ``no-sea approximation'' used in successful\ncovariant mean-field theory (MFT) calculations of static ground states. When\nexcited states are studied in the random-phase approximation (RPA), the same\nEFT scheme dictates the inclusion of both familiar particle-hole pairs and\ncontributions that mix valence and negative-energy single-particle Dirac wave\nfunctions. The modern EFT strategy therefore justifies and explains the\nomission of some explicit contributions from the negative-energy Dirac sea of\nnucleons, as was done to maintain conservation laws in earlier pragmatic\ncalculations of the nuclear linear response.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 May 2002 18:24:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 May 2002 12:43:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
