We probe the angular structure of the excess in the CBI deep\nfields and investigate whether it could be due to the scattering of CMB photons\nby hot electrons within clusters, the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect. We\nestimate the density fluctuation parameters for amplitude, sigma_8, and shape,\nGamma, from CMB primary anisotropy data and other cosmological data. We use the\nresults of two separate hydrodynamical codes for Lambda-CDM cosmologies,\nconsistent with the allowed sigma_8 and Gamma values, to quantify the expected\ncontribution from the SZ effect to the bandpowers of the CBI experiment and\npass simulated SZ effect maps through our CBI analysis pipeline. The result is\nvery sensitive to the value of sigma_8, and is roughly consistent with the\nobserved power if sigma_8 ~ 1. We conclude that the CBI anomaly could be a\nresult of the SZ effect for the class of Lambda-CDM concordance models if\nsigma_8 is in the upper range of values allowed by current CMB and Large Scale\nStructure (LSS) data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 May 2002 08:00:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Feb 2005 00:21:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We find\nthat only 40% of the mid-infrared (MIR) flux is associated with a compact\nnuclear region, while the rest of the emission originates from a rather diffuse\ncomponent extended over several kpc. This is in stark contrast with the very\ncompact MIR starbursts usually seen in luminous infrared galaxies. A secondary\npeak of MIR emission is associated with an extra-nuclear star forming region\nwhich displays the largest Halpha equivalent width in the whole system.\nComparing our data with the distribution of the molecular gas and cold dust, as\nwell as with radio observations, it becomes evident that the conversion of\nmolecular gas into stars can be triggered over large areas at the very first\nstages of an interaction. The presence of a very strong continuum at 5 microns\nin one of the sources indicates that an enshrouded active galactic nucleus may\ncontribute to 40% of its MIR flux. We finally note that the relative variations\nin the UV to radio spectral properties between the merging galaxies provide\nevidence that the extinction-corrected star formation rate of similar objects\nat high z, such as those detected in optical deep surveys, can not be\naccurately derived from their rest-frame UV properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 May 2002 13:19:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

This work constitutes a survey of the analyses that can be performed to\nstudy the interstellar gas when combining data from different instruments.\nLow-velocity (-18 to -8 km/s) components are seen primarily for various neutral\nand singly ionized species such as C I, O I, S I, Mg II, Cl I, Cl II, Mn II, Fe\nII and Cu II. Numerous lines of H2 are present in the FUSE spectra, with a\nkinetic temperature for the lowest rotational levels T_(01) = (90 +/- 10) K.\nAnalysis of the C I fine-structure excitation implies an average local density\nof hydrogen n_H = (16 +/- 3) cm^-3. The average electron density, derived from\nfive neutral/first ion pairs under the assumption of photoionization\nequilibrium, is n_e = (0.11 +/- 0.02) cm^-3. The relatively complex component\nstructure seen in high-resolution spectra of K I and Na I, the relatively low\naverage density, and the measured depletions all suggest that the line of sight\ncontains a number of diffuse clouds, rather than a single dense, translucent\ncloud.
