The entanglement-assisted capacities\nwere derived assuming an unlimited amount of shared entanglement per channel\nuse. In this paper, bounds are derived on the minimum amount of entanglement\nrequired per use of a channel, in order to asymptotically achieve the capacity.\nThis is achieved by introducing a class of entanglement-assisted quantum codes.\nCodes for classes of qubit channels are shown to achieve the quantum\nentanglement-assisted channel capacity when an amount of shared entanglement\nper channel given by, E = 1 - Q_E, is provided. It is also shown that for very\nnoisy channels, as the capacities become small, the amount of required\nentanglement converges for the classical and quantum capacities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 May 2002 11:03:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

A linearly changing\nexternal field applied along the quantization axis creates a network of well\nseparated level crossings in the energy diagram of the collective states. One\nor more transverse pulsed fields applied at the times of specific level\ncrossings induce adiabatic passage between these states. By choosing the timing\nof the pulsed field appropriately, one can transfer an initial product state of\nall N spins into (i) any symmetric state with n spin excitations and (ii) the\nN-particle analog of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state. This technique,\nunlike techniques using pulses of specific area, does not require precise\nknowledge of the number of particles and is robust against variations in the\ninteraction parameters. We discuss potential applications in two-component Bose\ncondensates and ion-trap systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 May 2002 12:09:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
