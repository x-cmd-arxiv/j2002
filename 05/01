The two fluids are assumed to be\n\"free\" in the sense of absence of vortex-mediated forces like mutual friction\nor pinning, but they can be coupled by the equation of state, in particular by\nentrainment.We calculate numerically the eigen-frequencies and -modes of\nadiabatic oscillations, neglecting beta-reactions that would lead to\ndissipation.We find a doubling of all acoustic-type modes (f-modes, p-modes),\nand confirm the absence of g-modes in these superfluid models. We show\nanalytically and numerically that only in the case of non-stratified background\nmodels (i.e. with no composition gradient) can these doublets of acoustic modes\nbe separated into two distinct families, which are characterised by either co-\nor counter-moving fluids respectively, and which are sometimes referred to as\n\"ordinary\" and \"superfluid\" modes. In the general, stratified case, however,\nthis separation is not possible, and these acoustic modes can not be classified\nas being either purely \"ordinary\" or \"superfluid\".

We first present a model-independent analysis in which we\ndiagonalise each of these two mass matrix structures to leading order in\n$\\theta_{13}$ and extract the neutrino masses, mixing angles and phases. In\nthis analysis we express the MNS matrix to leading order in the small angle\n$\\theta_{13}$ including the neutrino {\\em and} charged lepton mixing angles and\nphases, the latter playing a crucial r\\^{o}le for allowing the inverted\nhierarchy case to be consistent with the LMA MSW solution.

In each case we derive approximate analytic relations\nbetween the input see-saw parameters and the resulting neutrino masses, mixing\nangles and phases, which will provide a useful guide for unified model\nbuilding.

First, one may have a physical model which does not admit the usual\nLagrangian representation, as some terms can be discarded for various reasons.\nFor instance, the second-harmonic-generation (SHG) model considered here, which\nincludes the Kerr nonlinearity, lacks the usual Lagrangian representation if\none ignores the Kerr nonlinearity of the second harmonic, as compared to that\nof the fundamental. However, we show that, with a natural modification, one may\nstill apply the variational approximation (VA) to those seemingly flawed\nsystems as efficiently as it applies to their fully Lagrangian counterparts. We\ncall such models, that do not admit the usual Lagrangian representation,\n\\textit{semi-Lagrangian} systems. Second, we show that, upon adding an\ninfinitesimal tail that does not vanish at infinity, to a usual soliton ansatz,\none can obtain an analytical criterion which (within the framework of VA) gives\na condition for finding \\textit{embedded solitons}, i.e., isolated truly\nlocalized solutions existing inside the continuous spectrum of the radiation\nmodes. The criterion takes a form of orthogonality of the radiation mode in the\ninfinite tail to the soliton core. To test the criterion, we have applied it to\nboth the semi-Lagrangian truncated version of the SHG model and to the same\nmodel in its full form. In the former case, the criterion (combined with VA for\nthe soliton proper) yields an \\emph{exact} solution for the embedded soliton.\nIn the latter case, the criterion selects the embedded soliton with a relative\nerror $\\approx 1%$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2002 19:01:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Assuming a two-body\nprojectile of core plus loosely-bound valence particle and a model (the core\nrecoil model) in which the interaction of the valence particle and the target\ncan be neglected, we derive the non-adiabatic correction terms both exactly,\nusing a partial wave analysis, and using the eikonal approximation. Along with\nthe expected energy dependence of the corrections, there is also a strong\ndependence on the valence-to-core mass ratio and on the strength of the\nimaginary potential for the core-target interaction, which relates to\nabsorption of the core in its scattering by the target. The strength and\ndiffuseness of the core-target potential also determine the size of the\ncorrections. The first order non-adiabatic corrections were found to be smaller\nthan qualitative estimates would expect. The large absorption associated with\nthe core-target interaction in such halo nuclei as Be11 kills off most of the\nnon-adiabatic corrections. We give an improved estimate for the range of\nvalidity of the adiabatic approximation when the valence-target interaction is\nneglected, which includes the effect of core absorption. Some consideration was\ngiven to the validity of the eikonal approximation in our calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 May 2002 10:11:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

In the case\nof magnetic external forces acting on an ultrarelativistic beam, the\nlongitudinal self-interactions are responsible for CSR (Coherent Synchrotron\nRadiation)-related phenomena, which have been studied extensively. On the other\nhand, transverse self-interactions are present too. At the time being, existing\ntheoretical analysis of transverse self-forces deal with the case of a bunch\nmoving along a circular orbit only, without considering the situation of a\nbending magnet with a finite length. In this paper we propose an\nelectrodynamical analysis of transverse self-fields which originate, at the\nposition of a test particle, from an ultrarelativistic electron bunch moving in\nan arc of a circle. The problem will be first addressed within a two-particle\nsystem. We then extend our consideration to a line bunch with a stepped density\ndistribution, a situation which can be easily generalized to the case of an\narbitrary density distribution. Our approach turns out to be also useful in\norder to get a better insight in the physics involved in the case of simple\ncircular motion and in order to address the well known issue of the partial\ncompensation of transverse self-force.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 May 2002 07:10:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
