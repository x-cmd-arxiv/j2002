These observations\nsupersede shorter, undithered HST observations where an intermediate-age\npopulation of globular clusters was first discovered. The new observations show\nthe bimodal color distribution of globular clusters more clearly, with peaks at\n(V-I)o = 0.95 and 1.17. The luminosity function (LF) of the blue, metal-poor\npopulation of clusters in NGC 3610 turns over, consistent with a Gaussian\ndistribution with a peak Mv ~= -7.0, similar to old globular-cluster\npopulations in ellipticals. The red, metal-rich population of clusters has a LF\nthat is more extended toward both the bright and faint ends, as expected for a\ncluster population of inter-mediate age. It is well fit by a power law with an\nexponent of alpha = -1.78 +-0.05, or -1.90+-0.07 when corrected for\nobservational scatter. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test confirms the significant\ndifference between the LFs of the red and blue clusters, with a probability of\nless than 0.1% that they come from the same population. A comparison with the\nFall & Zhang cluster disruption models shows marginal agreement with the\nobserved LF, although there are differences in detail. In particular, there is\nno clear evidence of the predicted turnover at the faint end. A by-product of\nthe analysis is the demonstration that, at any given metallicity, the peak of\nthe LF should remain nearly constant from 1.5 Gyr to 12 Gyr, since the effect\nof the disruption of faint clusters is almost perfectly balanced by the fading\nof the clusters. This may help explain the apparent universality of the peak of\nthe globular cluster luminosity function.

First, we demonstrate that in order for the density of tachyon\nmatter to have an acceptable value today, the magnitude of the tachyon\npotential energy at the onset of rolling must be finely tuned. For a tachyon\npotential $V(T)\\sim M_{Pl}^4\\exp(-T/\\tau)$, the tachyon must start rolling at\n$T\\simeq 60\\tau$ in order for the density of tachyon matter today to satisfy\n$\\Omega_{T,0}\\sim 1$, provided that standard big bang cosmology begins at the\nsame time as the tachyon begins to roll. In this case, the value of\n$\\Omega_{T,0}$ is exponentially sensitive to $T/\\tau$ at the onset of rolling,\nso smaller $T/\\tau$ is unacceptable, and larger $T/\\tau$ implies a tachyon\ndensity that is too small to have interesting cosmological effects.

The new density-dependent\neffective interaction DD-ME1 is tested in the analysis of the equations of\nstate for symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter, and of ground-state\nproperties of the Sn and Pb isotopic chains. Results of self-consistent RHB\ncalculations are compared with experimental data, and with results previously\nobtained in the RHB model with non-linear self-interactions, as well as in the\ndensity dependent relativistic hadron field (DDRH) model. Parity-violating\nelastic electron scattering on Pb and Sn nuclei is calculated using a\nrelativistic optical model with inclusion of Coulomb distortion effects, and\nthe resulting asymmetry parameters are related to the neutron ground-state\ndensity distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 May 2002 10:52:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-05"}

The frame\ndependence is analyzed by allowing a nonvanishing plus component of the\nmomentum transfer, while the dynamical scale is set by the masses of the\nconstituents and by mass and size of the composite system. A transverse\nmomentum distribution, associated with the Bethe-Salpeter amplitude, is\nintroduced which allows to define strongly and weakly relativistic systems. In\nparticular, for strongly relativistic systems, the pair term vanishes for the\nDrell-Yan condition, while is dominant for momentum transfer along the\nlight-front direction. For a weakly relativistic system, fitted to the deuteron\nscale, the pair term is negligible up to momentum transfers of 1(GeV/c)$^2$.

Recently, Leung and Shor showed that the same amount of classical\ninformation as that in teleportation needs to be transmitted in any exact and\ndeterministic RSP protocol that is oblivious to Bob. We study similar RSP\nprotocols, but not necessarily oblivious to Bob. First it is shown that Bob's\nquantum operation can be safely assumed to be a unitary transformation. We then\nderive an equation that is a necessary and sufficient condition for such a\nprotocol to exist. By studying this equation, we show that one qubit RSP\nrequires 2 cbits of classical communication, which is the same amount as in\nteleportation, even if the protocol is not assumed oblivious to Bob.
