At zero temperature, we find that there is an avoided\ncritical point in the sense that the phase boundary in the limit $B\\to 0$ does\nnot connect to the B=0 critical point. Consequently, there exists a quasi-1D\nregime of the phase diagram, in which the competing order is largely confined\nto 1D ``halos'' about each vortex core, and in which interactions between\nneighboring vortices, although relevant at low temperature, are relatively\nweak.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 May 2002 21:53:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We\ncompute the anomalous dimensions of BMN operators at first order in g_2^2 and\nlambda' and interpret our result as the genus one mass renormalization of the\ncorresponding string state. We postulate a relation between the three-string\nvertex function and the gauge theory three-point function and compare our\nproposal to string field theory.

The main reason is that\nsuitable data was not available. However, calibration data recently produced by\nAffymetrix now permits detailed studies of the intensity dependent sensitivity.\nGiven a certain transcript concentration, it is of particular interest to know\nwhether current analysis methods are capable of detecting differential\nexpression ratios of 2 or higher. Using the calibration data, we demonstrate\nthat while current techniques are capable of detecting changes in the low to\nmid concentration range, the situation is noticeably worse for high\nconcentrations. In this regime, expression changes as large as 4 fold are\nseverely biased, and changes of 2 are often undetectable. Such effects are\nmainly the consequence of the sequence specific binding properties of probes,\nand not the result of optical saturation in the fluorescence measurements.\nGeneChips are manufactured such that each transcript is probed by a set of\nsequences with a wide affinity range. We show that this property can be used to\ndesign a method capable of reducing the high intensity bias. The idea behind\nour methods is to transfers the weight of a measurement to a subset of probes\nwith optimal linear response at a given concentration, which can be achieved\nusing local embedding techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 May 2002 18:58:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Aug 2002 16:42:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
