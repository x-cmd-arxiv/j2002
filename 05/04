Although a number of time-consuming\nhydrodynamical simulations combined with semi-analytic approaches have been\ncarried out, which permit a sophisticated treatment of some complicated\nprocesses in the formation and evolution of cosmic structures, the essential\nphysics behind the phenomenon still remains a subject of intense debate.

In the first case, the maximal CHSH violation\nbecomes small as the number of particle pairs tested becomes large. Hence,\nalthough in principle the memory loophole implies a slight flaw in existing\nanalyses of Bell experiments, the data still strongly confirm quantum mechanics\nagainst local hidden variables.\n  We consider also a related loophole, the {\\it simultaneous measurement\nloophole}, which applies if all measurements on each side are carried out\nsimultaneously.
