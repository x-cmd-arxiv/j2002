In most situations the entanglement is\ncreated for a very short time after the interaction with the heat bath is\nswitched on, but depending on system, coupling, and heat bath, the entanglement\nmay persist for arbitrarily long times. This mechanism sheds new light on the\ncreation of entanglement. A particular example of two quantum dots in a closed\ncavity is discussed, where the heat bath is given by the blackbody radiation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 May 2002 00:05:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 2003 05:41:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The\nidea is tested by the two models, the transverse Ising model and the traveling\nsalesman problem (TSP). Adding the transverse field to the Ising model is a\nsimple way to introduce quantum fluctuations. The strength of the transverse\nfield is controlled as a function of time similarly to the temperature in the\nconventional method. TSP can be described by the Ising spin, so that we also\napply the same technique to TSP. We directory solve the time-dependent\nSchr\\\"odinger equation for small-size systems and perform the quantum Monte\nCarlo simulation for large-size systems. Comparison with the results of the\ncorresponding classical (thermal) method reveals that the quantum method leads\nto the ground state with much larger probability in almost all cases if we use\nthe same annealing schedule of the control parameters. We also find that the\nrelaxation time is quite short for quantum systems by numerical simulations. We\nconsider this is one of the reasons why the annealing in quantum systems have a\nbetter performance of finding the optimal state in comparison with classical\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 May 2002 06:36:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
