We generalize this in two ways: In the first\ngeneralization we remove a set $\\Gamma$ from $\\Omega$ and concentrate our\nattention on $\\Lambda = \\Omega \\setminus \\Gamma$. This new domain might not\neven be connected and hence no Poincare inequality can generally hold for it,\nor if it does hold it might have a very bad constant. This is so even if the\nvolume of $\\Gamma$ is arbitrarily small. A Poincare inequality does hold,\nhowever, if one makes the additional assumption that $f$ has a finite $L^p$\ngradient norm on the whole of $\\Omega$, not just on $\\Lambda$. The important\npoint is that the Poincare inequality thus obtained bounds the $L^q$-norm of\n$f$ in terms of the $L^p$ gradient norm on $\\Lambda$ (not $\\Omega$) plus an\nadditional term that goes to zero as the volume of $\\Gamma$ goes to zero. This\nerror term depends on $\\Gamma$ only through its volume. Apart from this\nadditive error term, the constant in the inequality remains that of the `nice'\ndomain $\\Omega$. In the second generalization we are given a vector field $A$\nand replace $\\nabla $ by $\\nabla +i A(x)$ (geometrically, a connection on a\nU(1) bundle).

The huge amount\nof species found in nature demands a simple and robust mechanism. Yet, no\nconsensus has been reached concerning a reasonable disruptive selection\nmechanism that prevents mixing genes among the emerging species, especially\nwhen they live in sympatry. Usually it is assumed that females select males\naccording to their displaying traits, but males perform no selection on female\ntraits. However, recent experimental evidence accumulates towards the existence\nof male choice. Here we propose a robust mechanism for sympatric speciation,\nbased on the assumption that sexual selection operates in two directions:\nselection of males by females and of females by males. Complex mating\ninstabilities emerge, creating differential fitness depending on the\nindividuals displaying traits and preferences. When a secondary sexual trait is\nintroduced in a population, due to mutations, the activation of previously\nneutral genes or due to a different perception of already existent displaying\ntraits, sympatric speciation may result (together with a species recognition\nsystem) from a competitive exclusion principle. We suggest that potential\ncandidates to test our theory could be yeasts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 May 2002 22:12:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Therefore, in order to reduce the running time, it is\nessential to examine the minimum energy gap between the ground level and the\nnext one through the evolution. In this letter, we show a way of speedup in\nquantum adiabatic evolution algorithm, using the extended Hamiltonian. We\npresent the exact relation between the energy gap and the elements of the\nextended Hamiltonian, which provides the new point of view to reduce the\nrunning time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 May 2002 13:48:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2002 07:39:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
