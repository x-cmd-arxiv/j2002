Common goodness of fit methods are based on the calculation of\nthe distribution of certain statistical quantities under the assumption that\nthe model under consideration {\\it holds true}. This proceeding bears\nmethodological flaws, e.g. a good ``fit'' - albeit the model is wrong - might\nbe due to over-fitting, or to the fact that the chosen statistical criterion is\nnot powerful enough against the present particular deviation between model and\ntrue regression function. This causes particular difficulties when models with\ndifferent numbers of parameters are to be compared. Therefore the number of\nparameters is often penalised additionally. We provide a methodology which\ncircumvents these problems to some extent. It is based on the consideration of\nthe error distribution of the goodness of fit criterion under a broad range of\npossible models - and not only under the assumption that a given model holds\ntrue.

The idea is to\nanalyze the decomposition of a given pure system into blocks of $i$ interacting\nparticles by means of a mapping onto a hard rod mixture. This mapping uses the\nlocal activity of component $i$ of the mixture to control the local association\nof $i$ particles of the pure system. Thus it identifies the local particle\ndensity of component $i$ of the mixture with the local block density\n$\\varrho_i$ of the given system. Consequently, our overcomplete free energy\nfunctional takes on the hard rod mixture form with the set of block densities\n$\\varrho_i$ representing the sequence of partition functions of the local\naggregates of particle numbers $i$. The system of equations for the local\nparticle density $\\varrho$ of the original system is closed via a subsidiary\ncondition for the block densities in terms of $\\varrho$. Analoguous to the\nuniform isothermal-isobaric technique, all our results are expressible in terms\nof effective pressures. We illustrate the theory with two standard examples,\nthe adhesive interaction and the square-well potential. For the uniform case,\nour proof of such an overcomplete format is based on the exponential\nboundedness of the number of partitions of a positive integer (Hardy-Ramanujan\nformula) and on Varadhan's theorem on the asymptotics of a class of integrals.\nWe also discuss the applicability of our strategy in higher dimensional space,\nas well as models suggested thereof.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 May 2002 11:05:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Here the observable universe\nis confined to three spatial dimensions (a three-brane) embedded in higher\ndimensions. The only ingredients required are open strings on D-branes at\ntemperatures close to the string scale. No potential is required. Winding modes\nof the strings provide a negative pressure that can drive inflation of our\nobservable universe. Hence the mere existence of open strings on branes in the\nearly hot phase of the universe drives Hagedorn inflation, which can be either\npower law or exponential. We note the amusing fact that, in the case of\nstationary extra dimensions, inflationary expansion takes place only for branes\nof three or less dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 May 2002 23:05:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

The scheme\nmakes use of an additional intense field with frequency lower than the total\ndecay width of the atomic transition. This allows for additional decay channels\nwith the exchange of one or more low-frequency photons during an atomic\ntransition. The various channels may then interfere with each other. The\nintensity and the frequency of the low-frequency field are shown to act as two\ndifferent control parameters modifying the duration and the amount of the\npopulation trapping. An extension of the scheme to include transitions to more\nthan one lower state is straightforward.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 May 2002 09:31:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

It is shown that the dipole-dipole interaction and the atom-field\ninteraction, respectively, are closely related to the real part and the\nimaginary part of the (classical) Green tensor. The theory is applied to the\nstudy of the transient behavior of two atoms that initially share a single\nexcitation, with special emphasis on the role of the two competing processes of\nvirtual and real photon exchange in the energy transfer between the atoms. To\nillustrate the powerfulness of the theory, specific results for the case of the\natoms being near a dispersing and absorbing microsphere are presented.

This algorithm achieves an exponential advantage over the best known\nclassical factoring algorithms and its implementation represents a milestone in\nthe experimental exploration of quantum computation. These remarkable successes\nhave been made possible by the synthesis of suitable molecules and the\ndevelopment of many novel techniques for initialization, coherent control and\nreadout of the state of multiple coupled nuclear spins. Furthermore, we devised\nand implemented a model to simulate both unitary and decoherence processes in\nthese systems, in order to study and quantify the impact of various\ntechnological as well as fundamental sources of errors. In summary, this work\nhas given us a much needed practical appreciation of what it takes to build a\nquantum computer. While liquid NMR quantum computing has well-understood\nscaling limitations, many of the techniques that originated from this research\nmay find use in other, perhaps more scalable quantum computer implementations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 May 2002 15:02:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}
