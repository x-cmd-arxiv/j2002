Dekel, Devor & Hetzroni (2003) argue that a flat core of\na<1 exerts tidal compression which prevents local deposit of satellite\nmaterial; the satellite sinks intact into the halo center thus causing a rapid\nsteepening to a>1. Using merger N-body simulations, we learn that this cusp is\nstable under a sequence of mergers, and derive a practical tidal mass-transfer\nrecipe in regions where the local slope of the halo profile is a>1. According\nto this recipe, the ratio of mean densities of halo and initial satellite\nwithin the tidal radius equals a given function psi(a), which is significantly\nsmaller than unity (compared to being 1 according to crude resonance criteria)\nand is a decreasing function of a. This decrease makes the tidal mass transfer\nrelatively more efficient at larger a, which means steepening when a is small\nand flattening when a is large, thus causing converges to a stable solution.\nGiven this mass-transfer recipe, linear perturbation analysis, supported by toy\nsimulations, shows that a sequence of cosmological mergers with homologous\nsatellites slowly leads to a fixed-point cusp with an asymptotic slope a_as>1.\nThe slope depends only weakly on the fluctuation power spectrum, in agreement\nwith cosmological simulations. During a long interim period the profile has an\nNFW-like shape, with a cusp of 1<a<a_as. Thus, a cusp is enforced if enough\ncompact satellite remnants make it intact into the inner halo. In order to\nmaintain a flat core, satellites must be disrupted outside the core, possibly\nas a result of a modest puffing up due to baryonic feedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 May 2002 12:18:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Jan 2003 16:38:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We provide the\nprescriptions for computing S-matrix elements and Green functions in this\nframework. We also emphasize that the naive seemingly covariant approach cannot\nbe reproduced from the current one, in contrast to the field theory on ordinary\nspacetime. We attribute this to the phase-like nonlocal interaction intrinsic\nin NC field theory which modifies the analytic properties of Green functions\nsignificantly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 May 2002 11:12:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 2002 15:25:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-13"}
