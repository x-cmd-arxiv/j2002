The Palla & Stahler picture implies that most\nmolecular clouds should have extremely low rates of star formation, and that in\nsuch inactive stages the stellar initial mass function should be strongly\nskewed toward producing stars with masses $\\gtrsim 1 \\msun$; neither prediction\nis supported by observations.

Using photoelastic particles to\ndetermine forces at the grain scale, we experimentally show that disorder,\npacking structure, friction and texture significantly affect the average force\nresponse in granular systems. For packings with weak disorder, the mean forces\npropagate primarily along lattice directions. The width of the response along\nthese preferred directions grows with depth, increasingly so as the disorder of\nthe system grows. Also, as the disorder increases, the two propagation\ndirections of the mean force merge into a single direction. The response\nfunction for the mean force in the most strongly disordered system is\nquantitatively consistent with an elastic description for forces applied nearly\nnormally to a surface. These observations are consistent with recent\npredictions of Bouchaud et al. and with the anisotropic elasticity models of\nGoldenberg and Goldhirsch. At this time, it is not possible to distinguish\nbetween these two models. The data do not support a diffusive picture, as in\nthe q-model. This system with shear deformation is characterized by stress\nchains that are strongly oriented along an angle of 45 degrees, corresponding\nto the compressive direction of the shear deformation. In this case, the\nspatial correlation function for force has a range of only one particle size in\nthe direction transverse to the chains, and varies as a power law in the\ndirection of the chains, with an exponent of -0.81.
