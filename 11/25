Moreover, we\nshow that a typical degeneracy of the real eigenvalues (which reduces to the\nwell known Kramers degeneracy in the Hermitian case) occurs whenever a\nfermionic (possibly nondiagonalizable) pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian admits an\nantilinear symmetry like the time-reversal operator $T$. Some consequences and\napplications are briefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Nov 2002 11:55:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

Time orientability and existence of a cosmic\ntime are necessary conditions for defining an arrow of time, which is\nmanifested globally as the time-asymmetry of the universe as a whole, and\nlocally as a time-asymmetric energy flux. We also consider arrows of time of\ndifferent origins (quantum, electromagnetic, thermodynamic, etc.) showing that\nthey can be non-conventionally defined only if the geometrical arrow is\npreviously defined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Nov 2002 14:06:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
