Photoemission\nspectroscopy of the single particle spectral function is a central experimental\ntool for such studies. A general paradigm of quasi-particle formation is the\nFermi level resonance associated with the Kondo physics of the Anderson\nimpurity model, an effective self consisent version of which is utilized in\ndynamic mean field theories of general lattice systems which may or may not\nliterally display Kondo physics. A general paradigm of quasi-particle absence\nis the Luttinger liquid physics of the Tomonaga-Luttinger model. This paper\npresents an overview of the theoretical ideas and shows examples in\nphotoemission spectra, taken from the work of the author and his collaborators,\nof quasi-particle formation in impurity and lattice Kondo and non-Kondo\ncorrelated electron systems, contrasted with quasi-particle absence in a\nquasi-one-dimensional system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2002 22:51:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We focus on the onset of I-N coexistence. For a log-normal distribution\nwe find that a finite upper cutoff on rod lengths is required to make this\nproblem well-posed. The cloud curve, which tracks the density at the onset of\nI-N coexistence as a function of the width of the length distribution, exhibits\na kink; this demonstrates that the phase diagram must contain a three-phase\nI-N-N region.\n  Theoretical analysis shows that in the limit of large cutoff the cloud point\ndensity actually converges to zero, so that phase separation results at any\nnonzero density; this conclusion applies to all length distributions with\nfatter-than-exponentail tails. Finally we consider the case of a Schulz\ndistribution, with its exponential tail. Surprisingly, even here the long rods\n(and hence the cutoff) can dominate the phase behaviour, and a kink in the\ncloud curve and I-N-N coexistence again result.

The topology of\ncontacts is very different for the bulk than for the interface: while the bulk\ndisplays a rich network of interactions, the dimer interface is built up a set\nof essentially independent contacts. Consequently, the two sets of interactions\nplay very different roles both in the the folding and in the evolutionary\nhistory of the protein.

We treat a vacuum as a section in an appropriate\nbundle that is naturally associated with a minimum of a (general) Higgs\npotential. Such a vacuum spontaneously breaks the underlying gauge symmetry if\nthe invariance group of the vacuum is a proper subgroup of the gauge group. We\nshow that each choice of a vacuum admits to geometrically interpret the bosonic\nmass matrices as ``normal'' sections. The spectrum of these sections turns out\nto be constant over the manifold and independent of the chosen vacuum. Since\nthe mass matrices commute with the invariance group of the chosen vacuum one\nmay decompose the Hermitian vector bundles which correspond to the bosons in\nthe eigenbundles of the bosonic mass matrices. This decomposition is the\ngeometrical analogue of the physical notion of a ``particle multplet''. In this\nsense the basic notion of a ``free particle'' also makes sense within the\ngeometrical context of a gauge theory, provided the gauge symmetry is\nspontaneously broken by some vacuum.\n  We also discuss the Higgs-Kibble mechanism (``Higgs Dinner'') from a\ngeometrical point of view. It turns out that the ``unitary gauge'', usually\nencountered in the context of discussing the Higgs Dinner, is of purely\ngeometrical origin. In particular, we discuss rotationally symmetric Higgs\npotentials and give a necessary and sufficient condition for the unitary gauge\nto exist. As a specific example we discuss in some detail the electroweak\nsector of the standard model of particle physics in this context.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2002 17:16:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The classical Metabolic Control\nAnalysis (MCA), which quantifies the influence of an individual process on a\nsystem variable as the control coefficient, cannot be applied to spatially\nseparated protein networks. The present paper unravels the principles that\ngovern the control over the fluxes and intermediate concentrations in spatially\nheterogeneous reaction networks. Our main results are two types of the control\nsummation theorems. The first type is a non-trivial generalization of the\nclassical theorems to systems with spatially and temporally varying\nconcentrations. In this generalization, the process of diffusion, which enters\nas the result of spatial concentration gradients, plays a role similar to other\nprocesses such as chemical reactions and membrane transport. The second\nsummation theorem is completely novel. It states that the control by the\nmembrane transport, the diffusion control coefficient multiplied by two, and a\nnewly introduced control coefficient associated with changes in the spatial\nsize of a system (e.g., cell), all add up to one and zero for the control over\nflux and concentration. Using a simple example of a kinase/phosphatase system\nin a spherical cell, we speculate that unless active mechanisms of\nintracellular transport are involved, the threshold cell size is limited by the\ndiffusion control, when it is beginning to exceed the spatial control\ncoefficient significantly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Nov 2002 14:52:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Furthermore, every\nsurjective complex vector bundle map from the tangent bundle TX onto the\ntrivial bundle of rank q < n=dim X is homotopic to the differential of a\nholomorphic submersion of X to C^q.

The correlated states for nucleon matter are obtained\nby operating on Fermi-gas states by a symmetrized product of pair correlation\noperators determined from variational calculations with the Argonne v18 and\nUrbana IX two- and three-nucleon interactions. The squares of the charge\ncurrent matrix elements are found to be quenched by 20 to 25 % by the\nshort-range correlations in nucleon matter. Most of the quenching is due to\nspin-isospin correlations induced by the pion exchange interactions which\nchange the isospins and spins of the nucleons.

There is no\nplausible justification of Soler's law and the quantum ontology is partly too\nweak and partly too strong. We propose to replace this ontology by an ontology\nof unsharp properties and conclude that quantum mechanics is more intuitive\nthan classical mechanics and that classical mechanics is not the macroscopic\nlimit of quantum mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2002 18:14:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Apr 2003 13:14:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
