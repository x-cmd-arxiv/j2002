K\\\"ahler-Riemann foliations form an interesting subset of\nthe Riemannian foliations with remarkable properties (see [3]).\n  In this paper we will show that to give a regular Riemann Poisson structure\non a manifold $M$ is equivalent to to give a K\\\"ahler-Riemann foliation on $M$\nsuch that the leafwise symplectic form is invariant with respect to all local\nfoliate perpendicular vector fields. We show also that the sum of the vector\nspace of leafwise cohomology and the vector space of basic forms is a subspace\nof the space of Poisson cohomology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Nov 2002 10:18:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Physical\nparameters, such as vesicle size distribution and density of the lipid bilayer\nwere estimated and used as calculation parameters. By extrapolation of\ntransient potential change to zero time, the initial rate of the potential\nchange (dU/dt) has been calculated.
