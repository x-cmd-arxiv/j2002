We can,\nhowever, draw important conclusions about flux tubes in the interior of the Sun\nby combining additional arguments with the insights gained from solar dynamo\nsolutions. The polar magnetic field of the Sun is of order 10 G, whereas the\ntoroidal magnetic field at the bottom of the convection zone has been estimated\nto be 100,000 G. Simple order-of-magnitude estimates show that the shear in the\ntachocline is not sufficient to stretch a 10 G mean radial field into a 100,000\nG mean toroidal field. We argue that the polar field of the Sun must get\nconcentrated into intermittent flux tubes before it is advected to the\ntachocline. We estimate the strengths and filling factors of these flux tubes.\nStretching by shear in the tachocline is then expected to produce a highly\nintermittent magnetic configuration at the bottom of the convection zone. The\nmeridional flow at the bottom of the convection zone should be able to carry\nthis intermittent magnetic field equatorward, as suggested recently by Nandy\nand Choudhuri (2002). When a flux tube from the bottom of the convection zone\nrises to a region of pre-existing poloidal field at the surface, we point out\nthat it picks up a twist in accordance with the observations of current\nhelicities at the solar surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Nov 2002 10:02:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The analysis, which is performed using both\nthe ALEPH and OPAL databases for the V-A spectral function, Delta rho, allows\nus to extract the dimension six V-A OPE coefficient, a_6, which is related to\nthe matrix element of the electroweak penguin operator, Q_8, by chiral\nsymmetry. The result for a_6 leads directly to the improved (chiral limit)\ndetermination epsilon'/epsilon = (- 15.0 +- 2.7) 10^{-4}. Determination of\nhigher dimension OPE contributions also allows us to perform an independent\ntest using a low-scale constrained dispersive analysis, which provides a highly\nnontrivial consistency check of the results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Nov 2002 14:42:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-05"}

This fraction converges to zero in the thermodynamic\nlarge-particle-number limit. For hard-disk and hard-sphere systems the\nperturbations belonging to the small positive and large negative exponents are\ncoherently spread out and form orthogonal periodic structures in space, the\n``Lyapunov modes''.

Cyclic networks are those in which the qubit lines are\nloops. Here we have studied one and two qubit systems plus two qubit cyclic\nsystems connected to another qubit on an acyclic line. The analysis includes\nthe group classification of networks and studies of the dynamics of the qubits\nin the cyclic network and of the perturbation effects of an acyclic qubit\nacting on a cyclic network. This is followed by a discussion of quantum\nalgorithms and quantum information processing with cyclic networks of quantum\ngates, and a novel implementation of a cyclic network quantum memory. Quantum\nsensors via cyclic networks are also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2002 20:26:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

However, this does not imply a breakdown of\nnon-local correlation since the perfect anti-correlation is maintained in\nappropriately chosen different directions.
