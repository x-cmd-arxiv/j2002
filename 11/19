In the triaxial\nmodel we allow the extent along the line of sight to vary in order to describe\nelongated and compressed cluster shapes. Using a sample of 10 ROSAT clusters\nand a recent CHANDRA observation we find the following results. For prolate or\noblate shapes the difference between triaxial and spherical model both in the\nmass and in the gas mass fraction are negligible (less than 3 %). For more\naspherical shapes the total mass is underestimated (overestimated) in the\ncentre, if the cluster is compressed (elongated). The gas mass fraction is\noverestimated for compressed clusters and slightly underestimated for elongated\nclusters. Comparing X-ray masses with gravitational lensing estimates, we find\nthat elongations along the line of sight can resolve discrepancies of masses\ndetermined by the two different methods of up to ~30 %. The combination of\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich and X-ray observations is useful to measure the elongation\nof the cluster along the line of sight.

Both spectra are dominated by line\nemission from H- and He-like ions of C through S, and from Fe L-shell ions, but\nalso include narrow radiative recombination continua, indicating that most of\nthe soft X-ray emission arises in low-temperature (kT few eV) photoionized\nplasma.

The remarkable overlap and kinematical agreement of the\noptical and X-ray line emission, coupled with the need for a distribution of\nionization parameter to explain the X-ray spectra, collectively imply the\npresence of a distribution of densities (over a few orders of magnitude) at\neach radius in the ionization cone.

The high frequency power spectral\ndensity (PSD) of MCG-6-30-15 is examined in detail using a Monte Carlo fitting\nprocedure and is found to be well represented by a steep power-law at high\nfrequencies (with a power-law index alpha ~ 2.5), breaking to a flatter slope\n(alpha ~ 1) below f_br ~ 0.6 - 2.0 x 10^-4 Hz, consistent with the previous\nresults of Uttley, McHardy & Papadakis. The slope of the power spectrum above\nthe break is energy dependent, with the higher energies showing a flatter PSD.\nAt low frequencies the variations between different energy bands are highly\ncoherent while at high frequencies the coherence is significantly reduced. Time\nlags are detected between energy bands, with the soft variations leading the\nhard. The magnitude of the lag is small (<200 s for the frequencies observed)\nand is most likely frequency dependent.

The method is applied to calculate the renormalized\nphonon propagators along with the electron propagators as the onsite Coulomb\nrepulsion $U$ and electron-phonon coupling constant $g$ are varied. As $g$ is\nincreased, the phonon mode is successively renormalized, and for $g \\gtrsim\ng_{co}$ crosses over to the regime where the mode splits into two components,\none of which approaches back to the bare frequency and the other develops into\na soft mode.

In this formalism, the\nhopping order parameter of $physical$ electron is described by the product of\nhopping order parameters of spinon and holon. The staggered flux amplitude of\nelectron is the difference of staggered flux amplitude of spinon and that of\nholon.
