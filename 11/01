We prove that\ngenerically there will be a region surrounding the fixed point in which the\ncomplete general solution can be represented as a generalized Frobenius-like\npower series with exponents that are integer multiples of the exponents arising\nin the linearized problem. This Frobenius-like series can be viewed as a\nvariant of Liapunov's expansion theorem. As specific examples we apply these\nideas to Newtonian and relativistic isothermal stars and demonstrate (both\nnumerically and analytically) that the solution exhibits oscillatory power-law\nbehaviour as the star approaches the point of collapse. These series solutions\nextend classical results. (Lane, Emden, and Chandrasekhar in the Newtonian\ncase; Harrison, Thorne, Wakano, and Wheeler in the relativistic case.) We also\nindicate how to extend these ideas to situations where fixed points may not\nexist -- either due to ``monotone'' flow or due to the presence of limit\ncycles. Monotone flow generically leads to logarithmic deviations from scaling,\nwhile limit cycles generally lead to discrete self-similar solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Oct 2002 23:18:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

I show that, in an inertial frame of reference where\nthe dynamical equations are valid, it is incorrect to drop the quadratic terms\nbecause they are as large as the linear terms that are kept. I provide an\nalternate formulation of the problem by transforming the dynamical equations to\na corotating frame of reference of the disk/cylinder, where dropping the\nquadratic terms in displacement gradient is justified. The analysis shows that\nthe classic textbook derivation of stress and strain must be interpreted as\nbeing carried out in the corotating frame of the medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Nov 2002 03:14:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It is\nproved that for nondissipative media with temperature independent dielectric\npermittivity the energy at nonzero temperature comprises of the (renormalized)\nenergies of the zero-point and thermal photons. In this manner photons can be\nconsidered as collective elementary excitations of the matter of plates and\nelectromagnetic field. If the dielectric permittivity depends on temperature\nthe energy contains additional terms proportional to the derivatives of\ndielectric permittivity with respect to temperature, and the quasiparticle\ninterpretation of the fluctuating field is not possible. The correlation\nbetween energy and free energy is considered. Previous calculations of the\nCasimir energy in the framework of the Lifshitz formula at zero temperature and\noptical tabulated data supplemented by the Drude model at room temperature are\nanalysed. It is demonstrated that this quantity is not a good approximation\neither for the free energy or the energy. A physical interpretation of this\nhybrid quantity is suggested. The contradictory results in the recent\nliterature on whether the zero-frequency term of the Lifshitz formula for the\nperpendicular polarized modes has any effective contribution to the physical\nquantities are discussed. Four main approaches to the resolution of this\nproblem are specified. The precise expressions for entropy of the fluctuating\nfield between plates made of real metal are obtained, which helps to decide\nbetween the different approaches. The conclusion is that the Lifshitz formula\nsupplemented by the plasma model and the surface impedance approach are best\nsuited to describe the thermal Casimir force between real metals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Oct 2002 17:02:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The\nexistence requirement is essential because without physical models no\ncommunication or thinking would be possible.

The reason for interest in language is that language\nexpressions can have meaning, either as an informal language or as a formal\nlanguage associated with a mathematical or physical theory. It is noted that\nany universally applicable physical theory, or coherent theory of physics and\nmathematics together, includes in its domain physical models of expressons for\nboth the informal language used to discuss the theory and expressions of the\ntheory itself. It follows that there must be formulas in the formal theory that\nexpress some of their own physical properties.

Our work addresses the problem of constructing quantum circuits to\nimplement an arbitrary given quantum computation, in the special case of two\nqubits.

Our lower bound for worst-case optimal\ntwo-qubit circuits calls for at least 17 gates: 15 one-qubit rotations and 2\nCNOTs. To this end, we constructively prove a worst-case upper bound of 23\nelementary gates, of which at most 4 (CNOT) entail multi-qubit interactions.\nOur analysis shows that synthesis algorithms suggested in previous work,\nalthough more general, entail much larger quantum circuits than ours in the\nspecial case of two qubits.
