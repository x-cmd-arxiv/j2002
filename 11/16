Since\nthat time, improved tools for detailed modeling of atmospheric chemistry have\nbeen developed to calculate ozone depletion, and advances have been made in\ntheoretical modeling of supernovae and of the resultant gamma-ray spectra. In\naddition, one now has better knowledge of the occurrence rate of supernovae in\nthe galaxy, and of the spatial distribution of progenitors to core-collapse\nsupernovae. We report here the results of two-dimensional atmospheric model\ncalculations that take as input the spectral energy distribution of a\nsupernova, adopting various distances from Earth and various latitude impact\nangles. In separate simulations we calculate the ozone depletion due to both\ngamma-rays and cosmic rays. We find that for the combined ozone depletion\nroughly to double the ``biologically active'' UV flux received at the surface\nof the Earth, the supernova must occur at <8 pc. Based on the latest data, the\ntime-averaged galactic rate of core-collapse supernovae occurring within 8 pc\nis ~1.5/Gyr. In comparing our calculated ozone depletions with those of\nprevious studies, we find them to be significantly less severe than found by\nRuderman (1974), and consistent with Whitten et al. (1976). In summary, given\nthe amplitude of the effect, the rate of nearby supernovae, and the ~Gyr time\nscale for multicellular organisms on Earth, this particular pathway for mass\nextinctions may be less important than previously thought.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2002 16:05:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

It is assumed that the radio cocoon is poorly magnetically\nconnected to the environment. An extreme case of this kind is an insulating\nboundary layer of magnetic fields, which can efficiently suppress particle\nescape. More likely, magnetic field lines are less organised and allow the\ntransport of CR particles from the source interior to the surface region. For\nsuch a scenario two transport regimes are analysed: diffusion of particles\nalong inter-phase magnetic flux tubes (leaving the cocoon) and cross field\ntransport of particles in flux tubes touching the cocoon surface. The cross\nfield diffusion is likely the dominate escape path, unless a significant\nfraction of the surface is magnetically connected to the environment. Major\ncluster merger should strongly enhance the particle escape by two complementary\nmechanisms. i) The merger shock waves shred radio cocoons into filamentary\nstructures, allowing the CRs to easily reach the radio cocoon boundary due to\nthe changed morphology. ii) Also efficient particle losses can be expected for\nradio cocoons not compressed in shock waves. There, for a short period after\nthe sudden injection of large scale turbulence, the (anomalous) cross field\ndiffusion can be enhanced by several orders of magnitude.

The causal structure of\nspacetime on the brane is altered; it is described not by the usual metric\n$g_{\\mu\\nu}$, but instead by the open string metric, that incorporates the\nelectromagnetic background, $G_{\\mu\\nu} = g_{\\mu\\nu} - (2\\pi \\alpha^\\prime)^2\n(F^2)_{\\mu\\nu}$. The speed of light is now slower when propagating along\ndirections transverse to electromagnetic fields or an NS-NS two form, so that\nLorentz invariance is explicitly broken.

We derive a geometrical view of\nentanglement as a 'rotation' and 'stretching' of the sphere representing the\nstates of the second particle as measurements are performed on the first\nparticle. In the case of the singlet state entanglement can be represented by a\nreal physical constraint, namely by means of a rigid rod.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2002 21:31:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

The first\naxioms of standard quantum axiomatics (state determination and atomisticity)\nhave been shown to be equivalent to the $T_0$ and $T_1$ axioms of closure\nspaces, and classical properties to correspond to clopen sets, leading to a\ndecomposition theorem into classical and purely nonclassical components for a\ngeneral state property system. The concept of orthogonality, very important for\nquantum axiomatics, had however not yet been introduced within the formal\nscheme of the state property system. In this paper we introduce orthogonality\nin a operational way, and define ortho state property systems. Birkhoff's well\nknown biorthogonal construction gives rise to an orthoclosure and we study the\nrelation between this orthoclosure and the operational orthogonality that we\nintroduced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Nov 2002 12:03:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Feb 2003 13:50:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}
