These Centaurs spend most of their dynamical lifetimes in\norbits of eccentricity 0.2-to-0.6 and perihelion distance 12-to-30 AU. Their\norbital evolution is characterized by frequent close encounters with the giant\nplanets. Most of these Centaurs will escape from the solar system (or enter the\nOort Cloud), while a fraction will enter the JFC population and a few percent\nwill impact a giant planet. Their median dynamical lifetime is 9 Myr, although\nthere is a wide dispersion in lifetimes, ranging from less than 1 Myr to more\nthan 100 Myr.

In the special\nrelativity, this invariance is achieved by invoking the Lorentz transformation\nof space and time. In this investigation an entirely different interpretation\nof the invariance of force is presented. We propose a new model of the\nelectromagnetic force given in terms of the augmented potentials, which are\nderived from the electric scalar potential by incorporating a velocity\ndifference between involved particles. The propagation of the potentials is\nsupposed to follow the local-ether model. All of the position vectors, time\nderivatives, and velocities involved in the proposed potentials and force law\nare referred specifically to their respective frames. By virtue of this\nfeature, the electromagnetic force is independent of reference frame simply\nbased on Galilean transformations. The proposed model looks quite different\nfrom the Lorentz force law, except the electrostatic force. However, under the\ncommon low-speed condition where the mobile charged particles forming the\ncurrent drift very slowly in a neutralizing matrix, it is shown that the\nproposed model reduces to the Lorentz force law, if the latter is observed in\nthe matrix frame as done tacitly in common practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2002 07:57:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
