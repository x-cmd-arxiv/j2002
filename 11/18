In supergravity any familon field spontaneously\nbreaking this symmetry necessarily acquires an F-term which contributes to the\nsoft trilinear couplings. We show, as a result, mu -> e gamma decay can receive\nlarge contributions from this source at the level of current experimental\nbounds and thus this channel may provide the first indication of supersymmetry\nand a clue to the structure of the soft breaking sector. Using the mercury EDM\nbounds we find strong bounds on the right handed down quark mixing angles that\nare inconsistent with models relating them to neutrino mixing angles and favour\na near-symmetric form for the magnitude of the down quark mass matrix.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Nov 2002 15:26:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Apr 2003 11:41:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The scheme preserves quantum\nstates with a definite parity, and improves previous proposals for decoherence\ncontrol in cavities. It is implemented by sending single atoms, one by one,\nthrough the cavity. The atomic state gets first correlated to the photon number\nparity. The wrong parity results in an atom in the upper state. The atom in\nthis state is then used to inject a photon in the mode via adiabatic transfer,\ncorrecting the field parity. By solving numerically the exact master equation\nof the system, we show that the protection of simple quantum states could be\nexperimentally demonstrated using presently available experimental apparatus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Nov 2002 10:22:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
