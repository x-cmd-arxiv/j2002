In a collisionless n-body system, we know that particle motion is\ngoverned by the global potential rather than by inter-particle interactions. As\na result, the trajectory of each individual particle in the system is\nindependently shadowable. It is thus meaningful to measure the number of\nparticles that have shadowable trajectories as a function of time. We find that\nthe number of shadowable particles decays exponentially with time as exp(-mu\nt), and that for eps in [~0.2,1] (in units of the local mean inter-particle\nseparation $\\bar n$), there is an explicit relationship between the decay\nconstant mu, the timestep h of the leapfrog integrator, the softening eps, and\nthe number of particles N in the simulation. Thus, given N and eps, it is\npossible to pre-compute the timestep h necessary to acheive a desired fraction\nof shadowable particles after a given length of simulation time. We demonstrate\nthat a large fraction of particles remain shadowable over ~100 crossing times\neven if particles travel up to about 1/3 of the softening length per timestep.\nHowever, a sharp decrease in the number of shadowable particles occurs if the\ntimestep increases to allow particles to travel further than 1/3 the softening\nlength in one timestep, or if the softening is decreased below ~0.2$\\bar n$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Nov 2002 17:49:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

This instability is similar to the two-stream instability known to\noperate in plasmas. It is analogous to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, but\nhas the distinguishing feature that the two fluids are interpenetrating. The\ninstability sets in once the relative flow between the two components of the\nsystem reaches a critical level. Our analysis is based on the two-fluid\nequations that have been used to model the dynamics of the outer core of a\nneutron star, where superfluid neutrons are expected to coexist with\nsuperconducting protons and relativistic electrons. These equations are\nanalogous to the standard Landau model for superfluid Helium. We study this\ninstability for two different model problems. First we analyze a local\ndispersion relation for waves in a system where one fluid is at rest while the\nother flows at a constant rate. This provides a proof of principle of the\nexistence of the two-stream instability for superfluids. Our second model\nproblem concerns two rotating fluids confined within an infinitesimally thin\nspherical shell. The aim of this model is to assess whether the two-stream\ninstability may be relevant (perhaps as a trigger mechanism) for pulsar\nglitches.

We establish the algorithm of the one-point\nvariable and its moments in considering the effects of Poisson sampling and\nselection function. We also establish the mapping between the DWT one-point\nstatistics in redshift space and real space, i.e. the algorithm for recovering\nthe DWT one-point statistics from the redshift distortion of bulk velocity,\nvelocity dispersion, and selection function. Numerical tests on N-body\nsimulation samples show that this algorithm works well on scales from a few\nhundreds to a few Mpc/h for four popular cold dark matter models.\n  Taking the advantage that the DWT one-point variable is dependent on both the\nscale and the shape (configuration) of decomposition modes, one can design\nestimators of the redshift distortion parameter (beta) from combinations of DWT\nmodes. When the non-linear redshift distortion is not negligible, the beta\nestimator from quadrupole-to-monopole ratio is a function of scale. This\nestimator would not work without adding information about the scale-dependence,\nsuch as the power-spectrum index or the real-space correlation function of the\nrandom field. The DWT beta estimators, however, do not need such extra\ninformation. Numerical tests show that the proposed DWT estimators are able to\ndetermine beta robustly with less than 15% uncertainty in the redshift range 0\n< z < 3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2002 04:36:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The asymmetry is expressed as a\nproduct of chiral-odd distributions $h_1^\\perp(x_1,\\bm{p}_\\perp^2)\\times \\bar\nh_1^\\perp(x_2,\\bm{k}_\\perp^2) $, where the quark-transversity function\n$h_1^\\perp(x,\\bm{p}_\\perp^2)$ is the transverse momentum dependent, light-cone\nmomentum distribution of transversely polarized quarks in an {\\it unpolarized}\nproton. We compute this (naive) $T$-odd and chiral-odd distribution function\nand the resulting $\\cos 2 \\phi$ asymmetry explicitly in a quark-scalar diquark\nmodel for the proton with initial-state gluon interaction. In this model the\nfunction $h_1^\\perp(x,\\bm{p}_\\perp^2)$ equals the $T$-odd (chiral-even) Sivers\neffect function $f^\\perp_{1T}(x,\\bm{p}_\\perp^2)$. This suggests that the\nsingle-spin asymmetries in the SIDIS and the Drell-Yan process are closely\nrelated to the $\\cos 2 \\phi$ asymmetry of the unpolarized Drell-Yan process,\nsince all can arise from the same underlying mechanism. This provides new\ninsight regarding the role of quark and gluon orbital angular momentum as well\nas that of initial- and final-state gluon exchange interactions in hard QCD\nprocesses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Nov 2002 22:09:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-06"}

The quantum predictions are compared and\ncontrasted with the classical predictions of both Newtonian and Liouville\nmechanics. The time-domain scaling of the optimal quantum-classical\ncorrespondence is analyzed in detail in the case of both classical theories. In\nboth cases the correspondence for observable quantities is shown to break down\non a time-scale that increases very slowly (logarithmically) with increasing\nsystem size. In the case of quantum-Liouville correspondence such a short\ntime-scale does not imply a breakdown of correspondence since the largest\nquantum-Liouville differences reached on this time-scale decrease rapidly (as\nan inverse power) with increasing system size. Therefore the statistical\nproperties of chaotic dynamics are, as expected, well described by quantum\ntheory in the macroscopic limit. In contrast, the largest quantum-Newtonian\ndifferences reached on the log time-scale actually increase in proportion to\nthe system size. Since the invariance properties of the Hamiltonian impose\nfunctional constraints on the time-varying chaotic coordinates, it is possible\nto show, moreover, that if the quantum predictions are believed to describe the\ncoordinates of individual chaotic systems, then they also predict macroscopic\nviolations of any kinematic or dynamic constants of the motion. These results\nfor chaotic systems indicate that a valid description of the time-varying\nproperties of individual macroscopic bodies is not available within the\nstandard interpretive framework of quantum theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Nov 2002 22:28:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
