On the\nother hand, no plateaus occur with natural gradient descent regardless of the\ncorrelation for the limit of a low learning rate.

Remarkably, in Rosen coordinates the metric has a ``null\ncosmology'' interpretation with flat spatial sections and scale factor which is\na power of the light-cone time u. We show that: (i) This spacetime is a\nLorentzian homogeneous space. In particular, like Minkowski space, it admits a\nboost isometry in u,v. (ii) It is an exact solution of string theory when\nsupplemented by a u-dependent dilaton such that its exponent (i.e. effective\nstring coupling) goes to zero at u=infinity and at the singularity u=0,\nreducing back-reaction effects. (iii) The classical string equations in this\nbackground become linear in the light-cone gauge and can be solved explicitly\nin terms of Bessel's functions; thus the string model can be directly\nquantized. This allows one to address the issue of singularity at the\nstring-theory level. We examine the propagation of first-quantized\npoint-particle and string modes in this time-dependent background. Using\ncertain analytic continuation prescription we argue that string propagation\nthrough the singularity can be smooth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Nov 2002 17:35:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 2002 17:04:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}

Hales","title":"The Quantum Fourier Transform and Extensions of the Abelian Hidden\n  Subgroup Problem","comments":"PhD Thesis UC Berkeley Spring 2002","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"quant-ph","license":null,"abstract":"  The quantum Fourier transform (QFT) has emerged as the primary tool in\nquantum algorithms which achieve exponential advantage over classical\ncomputation and lies at the heart of the solution to the abelian hidden\nsubgroup problem, of which Shor's celebrated factoring and discrete log\nalgorithms are a special case. We begin by addressing various computational\nissues surrounding the QFT and give improved parallel circuits for both the QFT\nover a power of 2 and the QFT over an arbitrary cyclic group. These circuits\nare based on new insight into the relationship between the discrete Fourier\ntransform over different cyclic groups. We then exploit this insight to extend\nthe class of hidden subgroup problems with efficient quantum solutions. First\nwe relax the condition that the underlying hidden subgroup function be distinct\non distinct cosets of the subgroup in question and show that this relaxation\ncan be solved whenever G is a finitely-generated abelian group. We then extend\nthis reasoning to the hidden cyclic subgroup problem over the reals, showing\nhow to efficiently generate the bits of the period of any sufficiently\npiecewise-continuous function on R. Finally, we show that this problem of\nperiod-finding over R, viewed as an oracle promise problem, is strictly harder\nthan its integral counterpart. In particular, period-finding over R lies\noutside the complexity class MA, a class which contains period-finding over the\nintegers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Nov 2002 00:40:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
