We show by analytical considerations and three-dimensional\nradiation hydro simulations that, in particular, protoplanetary disks have a\nnegative radial entropy gradient, which makes them baroclinic. Two-dimensional\nnumerical simulations show that a baroclinic flow is unstable and produces\nturbulence. These findings are tested for numerical effects by performing a\nsimulation with a barotropic initial condition which shows that imposed\nturbulence rapidly decays. The turbulence in baroclinic disks transports\nangular momentum outward and creates a radially inward bound accretion of\nmatter. Potential energy is released and excess kinetic energy is dissipated.\nFinally the reheating of the gas supports the radial entropy gradient, forming\na self consistent process. We measure accretion rates in our 2D and 3D\nsimulations of dotM= - 1E-9 - 1E-7 Msun/yr and viscosity parameters of alpha =\n1E-4 - 1E-2, which fit perfectly together and agree reasonably with\nobservations.

Numerically integrating the\nSchroedinger equation in time reveals that for certain values of the strength\nand frequency of the field the tunneling between the dots can be destroyed,\nthus allowing the correlated two-electron states to be manipulated.

The resulting cross section is symmetric in the\nscattering angle as those obtained by Aharonov and Bohm (AB) in the string\nlimit and by Landau and Lifshitz (LL) for the non relativistic case. We show\nthat taking pr_0\\|sin(\\theta/2)|/\\hbar<<1 in our expression of the differential\ncross section it reduces to the one reported by AB, and if additionally we\nassume \\theta << 1 our result becomes the one obtained by LL. However, these\nlimits are explicitly singular in \\hbar as opposed to our initial result. We\nanalyze the singular behavior in \\hbar and show that the perturbative Planck's\nlimit (\\hbar -> 0) is consistent, contrarily to those of the AB and LL\nexpressions. We also discuss the scattering in a uniform and constant magnetic\nfield, which resembles some features of QCD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Nov 2002 02:29:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}
