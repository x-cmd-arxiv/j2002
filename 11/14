X-ray\nemission is detected from 7 of the 10 bright submm sources in this region,\ncorresponding to an X-ray detected submm source density of ~360 deg^-2 (>~36%\nof the bright submm source population). Two of the X-ray detected sources have\nnearby (within 3\") X-ray companions, suggesting merging/interacting sources or\ngravitational lensing effects, and 3 lie within the approximate extent of a\nproto-cluster candidate. Five of the X-ray detected sources have flat X-ray\nspectral slopes, suggesting obscured AGN activity. X-ray spectral analyses\nsuggest that one of these AGNs may be a Compton-thick source; of the other 4\nAGNs, 3 appear to be Compton-thin sources and one has poor constraints. The\nrest-frame unabsorbed X-ray luminosities of these AGNs are more consistent with\nthose of Seyfert galaxies than QSOs. Thus, the low X-ray detection rate of\nbright submm sources by moderately deep X-ray surveys appears to be due to the\nrelatively low luminosities of the AGNs rather than Compton-thick absorption. A\ncomparison of these sources to the well-studied heavily obscured AGN NGC6240\nshows that the average AGN contribution is negligible at submm wavelengths. The\nX-ray properties of the other 2 X-ray detected sources are consistent with\nthose expected from luminous star formation; however, we cannot rule out the\npossibility that low-luminosity AGNs are present.

This study is directly relevant to thermal radiation\nfrom the surfaces of highly magnetized neutron stars, which have been detected\nin recent years. Strong-field vacuum polarization modifies the photon\npropagation modes in the plasma, and induces a ``vacuum resonance'' at which a\npolarized X-ray photon propagating outward in the neutron star atmosphere can\nconvert from a low-opacity mode to a high-opacity mode and vice versa. The\neffectiveness of this mode conversion depends on the photon energy and the\natmosphere density gradient. For a wide range of field strengths, $7\\times\n10^{13}< B < 10^{16}$ G, the vacuum resonance lies between the photospheres of\nthe two photon modes, and the emergent radiation spectrum from the neutron star\nis significantly modified by the vacuum resonance. (For lower field strengths,\nonly the polarization spectrum is affected.) Under certain conditions, which\ndepend on the field strength, photon energy and propagation direction, the\nvacuum resonance is accompanied by the phenomenon of mode collapse (at which\nthe two photon modes become degenerate) and the breakdown of Faraday\ndepolarization. Thus, the widely used description of radiative transfer based\non photon modes is not adequate to treat the vacuum polarization effect\nrigorously. We study the evolution of polarized X-rays across the vacuum\nresonance and derive the transfer equation for the photon intensity matrix\n(Stokes parameters), taking into account the effect of birefringence of the\nplasma-vacuum medium, free-free absorption, and scatterings by electrons and\nions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2002 21:48:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2003 17:50:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Models are presented for three scenarios: bulges and disks of equal age,\nold bulges and delayed disk star formation, and old disks with subsequent bulge\nstar formation. We quantitatively show that bulge-to-total ($=$ B/T) light\nratios for local galaxies increase significantly from U through I-bands with\nthe rate of increase slightly depending on the relative ages of the two\ncomponents. Hence, simultaneous decomposition of galaxy profiles in several\nbands can give direct information about the relative ages of bulges and disks\nand help constrain galaxy formation scenarios. The redshift evolution of\nB/T-ratios in various bands U, B, V, I, H is calculated accounting both for\ncosmological and evolutionary corrections. I- and H-bands show the smoothest\nredshift evolution and, hence, are best suited for a first order comparison of\ngalaxies over the redshift range from ${\\rm z=0}$ to ${\\rm z \\gta 1}$ but still\nare shown to increasingly overestimate B/T ratios at higher redshifts. This is\na robust result irrespective of the respective ages of the bulge and disk\nstellar components and implies that the scarcity of bulge-strong systems at\n${\\rm z \\geq 0.8}$ reported for HDF and Hawaiian Deep Field galaxies is further\nenhanced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2002 14:46:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We found that it has\nbeen interacting with the surrounding ISM and has formed a bow shock due to its\nhigh velocity of about 180 km/s relative to the local ISM. The star is about\n1.3 parsec away from the front of this bow shock. The outbursts that are\nresponsible for the nebula are assumed to be discrete outbursts that occurred\ninside this bow shock. The ejecta collide with this bow shock shortly after the\noutburst. After the collision, they are dragged away by the pressure of the\nISM, along the surface of the bow shock. The bow shock is oriented in such way\nthat we are looking from the rear into this paraboloid, almost along the main\naxis. Evidence for this is given firstly by the fact that the far hemisphere is\nmuch brighter than the near hemisphere, secondly by the fact that there is\nhardly any emission found with radial velocities higher than the star's radial\nvelocity, thirdly by the fact that the star looks to be in the centre of the\nnebula, as seen from Earth, and finally by the asymmetric overall velocity\ndistribution of the nebula, which indicates higher radial velocities in the\ncentre of the nebula, and lower velocities near the edges. We find evidence for\nat least two discrete outbursts that occurred inside this bow shock. For these\noutbursts, we find expansion velocities of about 150 km/s and dynamical\ntimescales of about 8 and 20 kyr, which are typical values for LBV outbursts.\nWe therefore conclude that M1-67 originates from several outbursts that\noccurred inside the bow shock around WR 124, during an LBV phase that preceded\nthe current WR phase of the star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2002 13:33:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Is the formula XCB =\ne(x,e(e(e(x,y),e(z,y)),z)) a single axiom for the classical equivalential\ncalculus when the rules of inference consist of detachment (modus ponens) and\nsubstitution? Where the function e represents equivalence, this calculus can be\naxiomatized quite naturally with the formulas e(x,x), e(e(x,y),e(y,x)), and\ne(e(x,y),e(e(y,z),e(x,z))), which correspond to reflexivity, symmetry, and\ntransitivity, respectively.

We first compute the trace anomaly of a Dirac fermion in 4\ndimensions, providing an additional check on the regularization with finite\npropagation time.

The key to the proof is the\nconstruction of a non-degenerate alternating form on the quotient of the Selmer\ngroup of $E$ by its divisible part. In order to construct this form,\nNekov\\'a\\v{r} completely redoes the theory of Selmer groups, using the\nformalism of complexes. He thereby obtains other applications in the theory due\nto Hida and others. Here we will simplify this construction and place these\nresults in a more general context.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2002 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
