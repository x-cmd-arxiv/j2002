The disc model had H/r=0.1,and a value\nof the Shakura & Sunyaev alpha ~ 0.005. The protoplanet opened a gap in the\ndisc, with the interaction leading to inward migration on the expected time\nscale. Spiral waves were launched by the protoplanet and although they were\ndiffused and dissipated through interaction with the turbulence, they produced\nan outward angular momentum flow which compensated for a reduced flux\nassociated with the turbulence, so maintaining the gap. When compared with\nlaminar disc models with the same estimated alpha, the gap was found to be\ndeeper and wider indicating that the turbulent disc behaved as if it possessed\na smaller alpha. This may arise for two reasons. First, the turbulence does not\nprovide a source of constantly acting friction in the near vicinity of the\nplanet that leads to steady mass flow into the gap region. Instead the\nturbulence is characterised by large fluctuations in the radial velocity, and\ntime averaging over significant time scales is required to recover the\nunderlying mass flow through the disc. Near the planet the disc material\nexperiences high amplitude perturbations on time scales that are short relative\nto the time scale required for averaging. The disc response is thus likely to\nbe altered relative to a Navier--Stokes model. Second, the simulation indicates\nthat an ordered magnetic connection between the inner and outer disc can occur\nenabling angular momentum to flow out across the gap, helping to maintain it\nindependently of the protoplanet's tide.

To calculate these QCD\ncorrections, a special calculational technique for pentagon diagrams has been\ndeveloped and the dipole subtraction formalism has been adopted for massive\nparticles. The impact of the corrections on the total cross sections is\ncharacterized by K factors, the ratios of the cross sections in next-to-leading\norder over leading order QCD. At the central scale mu_0 = (2 m_t + M_H)/2 the K\nfactors are found to be slightly below unity for the Tevatron (K \\sim 0.8) and\nslightly above unity for the LHC (K \\sim 1.2). Including the corrections\nsignificantly stabilizes the theoretical predictions for total cross sections\nand for the distributions in rapidity and transverse momentum of the Higgs\nboson and top quarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Nov 2002 11:23:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-05"}

We determine all R-parity violating couplings which can\ncontribute to the effective neutrino oscillations, and summarize the present\nlaboratory bounds.

For first order operators\nthese reductions (and multi-component analogs thereof) lead to the Lame\nequations descriptive of orthogonal coordinate systems. Our main observation is\nthat $n$-th order reductions coincide with the projective-geometric\n`Gauss-Codazzi' equations governing special classes of line congruences in the\nprojective space $P^{2n-1}$, which is the projectivised kernel of $D_n$. In the\nsecond order case this leads to the theory of $W$-congruences in $P^3$ which\nbelong to a linear complex, while the third order case corresponds to isotropic\ncongruences in $P^5$.

All these flows preserve the kernel $D_n$, thus\ndefining nontrivial geometric evolutions of line congruences. Multi-component\ngeneralizations are also discussed.
