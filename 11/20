Our analysis shows that the halo\ncore (r<2-3 r_e) and the external halo (r>3 r_e) are characterised by different\ndynamical properties and suggests a different origin of the two components. The\nhalo core has a complex morphology with a main X-ray emission peak, coincident\nwith the center of the optical galaxy, and several secondary peaks. The spatial\nand spectral analysis of the central peak shows that this feature is produced\nby denser hot gas in the galaxy core.

Comparison with previously\npublished studies suggest that the core of X-ray extended galaxies is\nassociated to the stellar distribution and has similar properties to the X-ray\nhalo of compact galaxies. The secondary peaks are due instead to interactions\nbetween the radio-emitting plasma and the surrounding ISM.

The\nproperties of ``transition'' (dSph/dIrr) galaxies in Sculptor and the Local\nGroup are also compared and found to be similar. The transition galaxies are\ntypically among the lowest luminosities of the gas rich dwarf galaxies.\nRelative to the dwarf irregular galaxies, the transition galaxies are found\npreferentially nearer to spiral galaxies, and are found nearer to the center of\nthe mass distribution in the local cloud. While most of these systems are\nconsistent with normal dI galaxies which currently exhibit temporarily\ninterrupted star formation, the observed density-morphology relationship (which\nis weaker than that observed for the dwarf spheroidal galaxies) indicates that\nenvironmental processes such as ``tidal stirring'' may play a role in causing\ntheir lower SFRs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2002 10:51:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

For processes in which both mean application times\nare finite, the scaling behavior follows that of the corresponding cyclical\nprocess in which the uniform application time of each primary process is given\nby its mean. If the distribution functions decay with a small enough power law\nfor the mean application times to diverge, the growth exponent is found to\ndepend continuously on this power law exponent. In contrast, the roughness\nexponent does not depend on the timing of the applications. The analytical\nresults are supported by numerical simulations of various pairs of primary\nprocesses and with different distribution functions. Self-affine surfaces grown\nby two randomly alternating processes are common in nature (e.g., due to\nrandomly changing weather conditions) and in man-made devices such as\nrechargeable batteries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2002 01:30:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

It is demonstrated that the geometrical origin of the\nquantum potential is in the scalar curvature of the of the metric that defines\nthe kinetic energy density for an extended particle and that the quantization\nof circulation (Bohr-Sommerfeld) is a consequence of associating an\nSO(2)-reduction of the Lorentz frame bundle with wave motion. The Madelung\nequations are then cast in a basis-free form in terms of exterior differential\nforms in such a way that they represent the equations for a timelike solution\nto the conventional wave equations whose rest mass density satisfies a\ndifferential equation of the \"Klein-Gordon minus nonlinear term\" type. The role\nof non-zero vorticity is briefly examined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2002 16:10:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In the present work we report calculations made for\nthe excitations of quark matter for relatively low densities of the deconfined\nphase and in the absence of meson or diquark condensation. Here, we are\ninterested in elucidating the role of \"Pauli blocking\", as such blocking\naffects the calculation vector, scalar and pseudoscalar $q\\bar q$ excitations.\nAs a byproduct of our analysis, we extend our calculations to higher densities\nand explore some consequences of the use of density-dependent coupling\nparameters for the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. (Such density-dependent\nparameters have been used in some of our previous work.) For our analysis made\nat large values of the matter density, we assume that at about 13 times nuclear\nmatter density quark matter has only minimal nonperturbative interactions. At\nthat high density we compare the result for hadronic current correlation\nfunctions calculated with density-dependent and density-independent NJL\ncoupling constants. We find evidence for the use of density-dependent\nparameters, since the results with the density-independent constants do not go\nover to the perturbative description which we assume to be correct for\n$\\rho\\simeq 6\\rho_c$, where $\\rho_c$ is the matter density for the\nfinite-density confinement-deconfinement transition. The use of\ndensity-dependent coupling constants in the study of diquark condensates and\ncolor superconductivity has not been explored as yet, and is a topic requiring\nfurther investigation, particularly given the strong interest in the properties\nof dense quark matter and color superconductivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2002 15:30:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2002 16:21:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 20 Dec 2002 15:42:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

When the underlying group is non-Abelian, two important variants of\nthe Fourier sampling paradigm have been identified: the weak standard method,\nwhere only representation names are measured, and the strong standard method,\nwhere full measurement occurs. It has remained open whether the strong standard\nmethod is indeed stronger, that is, whether there are hidden subgroups that can\nbe reconstructed via the strong method but not by the weak, or any other known,\nmethod.

Imperfections of the apparatuses, such as nonunit quantum efficiency\nand finite resolution, are taken into account. We show that conditional {\\sc\non/off} photodetection provides a reliable scheme to verify nonclassicality,\nwhereas conditional homodyning represents a tunable and robust source of\nsqueezed light. We also describe optical teleportation as a conditional\nmeasurement, and evaluate the degrading effects of finite amount of\nentanglement, decoherence due to losses, and nonunit quantum efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2002 09:34:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
