By virtue of a combined spatial\nand spectral analysis, we have been able to model the X-ray emission of the\nremnant as a sum of two components: a non-thermal component, due to the pulsar\nnebula and the pulsar itself, and a thermal component, of which we have\nanalysed spectrum and morphology, after proper subtraction of the plerion. We\ndiscuss three possible interpretations of the thermal emission of \\src: pure\nSedov expansion, expansion through a inhomogeneous medium with evaporation from\nISM clouds, and radiative expansion. On the light of our new data and\ninterpretation, we have re-derived all the physical parameters of this SNR. In\nthe framework of Sedov or radiative expansion we derive a longer age than\npreviously estimated ($1.1\\times 10^4$), thus not requiring a high velocity for\nthe pulsar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 2002 11:25:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

This material is a good (albeit\ncorrelated) Fermi liquid in the normal state and an exotic superconductor below\nTc. The mechanism of superconductivity and symmetry of the order parameter are\nthe main puzzling issues of on-going research. Here we present the results of\nour search for a viable description of the superconducting state realised in\nthis material. Our calculations are based on a three-dimensional effective\nthree-band model with a realistic band structure. We have found a state with\nnon-zero order parameter on each of the three sheets of the Fermi surface. The\ncorresponding gap in the quasi-particle spectrum has line or point nodes on the\nalpha and beta sheets and is complex with no nodes on the gamma sheet. This\nstate describes remarkably well a number of existing experiments including\npower low temperature dependence of the specific heat, penetration depth,\nthermal conductivity etc. The stability of the state with respect to disorder\nand different interaction parameters are also analyzed briefly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 2002 12:12:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

B 5, S190 (2003)","doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"quant-ph","license":null,"abstract":"  The collective Raman cooling of trapped one- and two-component Fermi gases is\nconsidered. We obtain the quantum master equation that describes the laser\ncooling in the festina lente regime, for which the heating due to photon\nreabsorption can be neglected. For the two-component case the collisional\nprocesses are described within the formalism of quantum Boltzmann master\nequation. The inhibition of the spontaneous emission can be overcome by\nproperly adjusting the spontaneous Raman rate during the cooling. Our numerical\nresults based in Monte Carlo simulations of the corresponding rate equations,\nshow that three-dimensional temperatures of the order of $0.08 T_F$\n(single-component) and $0.03 T_F$ (two-component) can be achieved. We\ninvestigate the statistical properties of the equilibrium distribution of the\nlaser-cooled gas, showing that the number fluctuations are enhanced compared\nwith the thermal distribution close to the Fermi surface. Finally, we analyze\nthe heating related to the background losses, concluding that our laser-cooling\nscheme should maintain the temperature of the gas without significant\nadditional losses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 2002 15:47:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Mar 2003 15:21:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
