The\nobservation was performed with the ACIS-I detector onboard Chandra and yielded\ndata of high spatial and temporal resolution, together with spectral\ninformation. Mars is clearly detected as an almost fully illuminated disk, with\nan indication of limb brightening at the sunward side, accompanied by some\nfading on the opposite side. The morphology and the X-ray luminosity of ~4 MW\nare fully consistent with fluorescent scattering of solar X-rays in the upper\nMars atmosphere. The X-ray spectrum is dominated by a single narrow emission\nline, which is most likely caused by O-K_alpha fluorescence. No evidence for\ntemporal variability is found. This is in agreement with the solar X-ray flux,\nwhich was almost constant during the observation. In addition to the X-ray\nfluorescence, there is evidence for an additional source of X-ray emission,\nindicated by a faint X-ray halo which can be traced to about three Mars radii,\nand by an additional component in the X-ray spectrum of Mars, which has a\nsimilar spectral shape as the halo. Within the available limited statistics,\nthe spectrum of this component can be characterized by 0.2 keV thermal\nbremsstrahlung emission. This is indicative of charge exchange interactions\nbetween highly charged heavy ions in the solar wind and exospheric hydrogen and\noxygen around Mars. Although the observation was performed at the onset of a\nglobal dust storm, no evidence for dust-related X-ray emission was found.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 2002 17:02:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
