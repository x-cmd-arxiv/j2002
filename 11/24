Charge correlations and average relative velocities for mid-velocity\nfragment emission exhibit significant differences when compared to standard\nstatistical decay. These differences associated with similar velocity\ndissipation are indicative of the influence of the entrance channel dynamics on\nthe fragment production process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Nov 2002 00:00:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

It was found that the spin\nrelaxation mechanism of alpha-H nucleus of D-alanine molecule is different from\nL-alanine and the effect is stronger than that of L-alanine. In addition,\nD-alanine undergoes a magnetic phase transition at a field of 1.0T, which is\nconfirmed by a peak-form ultrasonic attenuation curve. DC-magnetic\nsusceptibilities measurements of L-alanine also indicate abnormal magnetic\nproperties, which is accompanied by a step-form ultrasonic attenuation jump and\nits mechanism seems different from that of D-alanine. The phase transition is\nconsidered to act as a cooperating amplification mechanism of the P-odd effects\nat the molecular level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Nov 2002 16:52:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 22 Dec 2002 16:20:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
