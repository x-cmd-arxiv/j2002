The total K-band luminosity, which mainly comes from\nthe central host galaxy, and the measured HI linewidth at 20% of the peak line\nflux density, which traces the potential in the polar plane, place most polar\nrings of the sample far from the Tully-Fisher relation defined for spiral\ngalaxies, with many PRGs showing larger HI linewidths than expected for the\nobserved K band luminosity. This result is confirmed by a larger sample of\nobjects, based on B-band data. This observational evidence may be related to\nthe dark halo shape and orientation in these systems, which we study by\nnumerical modeling of PRG formation and dynamics: the larger rotation\nvelocities observed in PRGs can be explained by a flattened polar halo, aligned\nwith the polar ring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2002 11:34:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Therefore a detailed description of the interaction of gas and dust is a\nprerequisite for realistic models of such winds. In this paper we present the\nmethod and first results of a three-component time-dependent model of\ndust-driven AGB star winds. With the model we plan to study the role and\neffects of the gas-dust interaction on the mass loss and wind formation. The\nwind model includes separate conservation laws for each of the three components\nof gas, dust and the radiation field and is developed from an existing model\nwhich assumes position coupling between the gas and the dust. As a new feature\nwe introduce a separate equation of motion for the dust component in order to\nfully separate the dust phase from the gas phase. The transfer of mass, energy\nand momentum between the phases is treated by interaction terms. We also carry\nout a detailed study of the physical form and influence of the momentum\ntransfer term (the drag force) and three approximations to it. In the present\nstudy we are interested mainly in the effect of the new treatment of the dust\nvelocity on dust-induced instabilities in the wind. As we want to study the\nconsequences of the additional freedom of the dust velocity on the model we\ncalculate winds both with and without the separate dust equation of motion. The\nwind models are calculated for several sets of stellar parameters. We find that\nthere is a higher threshold in the carbon/oxygen abundance ratio at which winds\nform in the new model. The winds of the new models, which include drift, differ\nfrom the previously stationary winds, and the winds with the lowest mass loss\nrates no longer form.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2002 12:49:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

In\nparticular, the (gauge-fixed) noncommutative plane, fuzzy sphere and torus\nexhibit a self-similar structure under blocking up, if some ``counterterm''\nmatrices are added to the resulting block-algebras. Applying these techniques\nto matrix representations of more general D-brane configurations, we find that\nblocking up averages over far-off-diagonal matrix elements and brings them in\ntowards the diagonal, so that the matrices become ``less off-diagonal'' under\nthis process. We describe heuristic scaling relations for the matrix elements\nunder this process.

Nevertheless, our result does not\ncontradict to the well known Bell's ``NO-GO'' theorem. J. Bell used the\nconventional (Kolmogorov) measure-theoretical approach. We use the frequency\napproach. In the latter approach there are no reasons to assume that the\nsimultaneous probability distribution exists: corresponding frequencies may\nfluctuate and not approach any definite limit (which Bell would like to use as\nthe probability). The frequency probabilistic derivation demonstrated that\nincompatibility of observables under consideration plays the crucial role in\nproducing of the EPR-Bohm correlations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2002 10:56:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 1 Dec 2002 16:10:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 28 Apr 2003 19:22:25 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 20 Jul 2003 09:45:08 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 23 Jul 2004 17:33:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

These correlations are not due to\nthermal fluctuations but to the intricate structure of a strongly entangled\nground state of the system. We present a microscopic computation of the scaling\nproperties of the ground-state entanglement in several 1D spin chain models\nboth near and at the quantum critical regimes. We quantify entanglement by\nusing the entropy of the ground state when the system is traced down to $L$\nspins. This entropy is seen to scale logarithmically with $L$, with a\ncoefficient that corresponds to the central charge associated to the conformal\ntheory that describes the universal properties of the quantum phase transition.\nThus we show that entanglement, a key concept of quantum information science,\nobeys universal scaling laws as dictated by the representations of the\nconformal group and its classification motivated by string theory. This\nconnection unveils a monotonicity law for ground-state entanglement along the\nrenormalization group flow. We also identify a majorization rule possibly\nassociated to conformal invariance and apply the present results to interpret\nthe breakdown of density matrix renormalization group techniques near a\ncritical point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2002 10:57:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
