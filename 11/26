When these structures form, it becomes\nenergetically favorable for single holes, pairs of holes or small bound-hole\nclusters to hop from one hole-rich domain to another due to quantum\nfluctuations. However, we find that at temperature of approximately 100 K, the\nprobability for bound hole-pair exchange between neighboring hole-rich regions\nin the stripe phase, is one or two orders of magnitude larger than single-hole\nor multi-hole droplet exchange. As a result holes in a given hole-rich domain\npenetrate further into the antiferromagnetically aligned domains when they do\nit in pairs. At temperature of about 100 K and below bound pairs of holes hop\nfrom one hole-rich domain to another with high probability. Therefore our main\nfinding is that the presence of the antiferromagnetic hole-poor domains act as\na filter which selects, from the hole-rich domains (where holes form a\nself-bound liquid), hole pairs which can be exchanged throughout the system.\nThis fluid of bound hole pairs can undergo a superfluid phase ordering at the\nabove mentioned temperature scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Nov 2002 19:45:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Our findings are summarized as: (i)The saddle points implying\nthe {\\it gliding motion} of a single {\\it floater} over the cluster surface\nyields extremely small values of the energy barriers regardless of the shapes\nof clusters. In particular, the {\\it gliding motion} of a train composed of a\nfew surface atoms also appears as the low-lying saddles. As a result, the\nbarrier height corresponding to the {\\it simultaneous gliding motion}, which is\na manifestation of the reaction path crossing the higher-index saddles on PES,\nis significantly low. (ii)A surface rearrangement, where {\\it floaters} are\ncreated or annihilated, implies relatively high barrier energy which is still\naccessible below melting point. (iii)On the other hand, the atomic motion,\nwhere atoms located deep inside of the clusters are rearranged as well as\nsurface atoms, yields extremely high barrier energies. Some relations between\nthese results and the recent experimental study of the surface cluster\ndiffusion are also pointed out.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2002 14:37:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Recently, a remarkable fact was discovered that for a specific\npattern of the neutrino mass matrix at a high scale, any flavor-changing\nradiative correction will automatically lead to the desired mixing matrix. It\nwas also discovered that the required specific pattern at the high scale can be\nmaintained by the non-Abelian discrete symmetry A_4 which is also the symmetry\ngroup of the regular tetrahedron, one of five perfect geometric solids known to\nPlato who associated it with the element ``fire''. I discuss this recent\ndevelopment and add to it a new and very simple mechanism for the\nimplementation of the flavor-changing radiative correction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Nov 2002 21:01:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-05"}

In confining theories without matter fields in fundamental\nrepresentation the magnetic symmetry is spontaneously broken. Under some mild\nassumptions, the low-energy dynamics is determined universally by this\nspontaneous breaking phenomenon. The degrees of freedom in the effective theory\nare magnetic vortices. Their role in confining dynamics is similar to that\nplayed by pions and sigma in the chiral symmetry breaking dynamics.\n  I give an explicit derivation of the effective theory in (2+1)-dimensional\nweakly coupled confining models and argue that it remains qualitatively the\nsame in strongly coupled (2+1)-dimensional gluodynamics. Confinement in this\neffective theory is a very simple classical statement about the long range\ninteraction between topological solitons, which follows (as a result of a\nsimple direct classical calculation) from the structure of the effective\nLagrangian. I show that if fundamentally charged dynamical fields are present\nthe magnetic symmetry becomes local rather than global. The modifications to\nthe effective low energy description in the case of heavy dynamical fundamental\nmatter are discussed.
