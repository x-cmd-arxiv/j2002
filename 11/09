We measure the abundance variations of numerous elements in\nthese low mass stars with a range of ages (1-15Gyr old). This means that we can\neffectively measure the chemical evolution of these galaxies WITH TIME. Our\nresults show a significant spread in metallicity with age, but an overall trend\nconsistent with what might be expected from a closed (or perhaps leaky) box\nchemical evolution scenario over the last 10-15Gyr. We notice that each of\nthese galaxies show broadly similar abundance patterns for all elements\nmeasured. This suggests a fairly uniform progression of chemical evolution with\ntime, despite quite a large range of star formation histories. It seems likely\nthat these galaxies had similar initial conditions, and evolve in a similar\nmanner with star formation occurring at a uniformly low rate, even if at\ndifferent times. With our accurate measurements we find evidence for small\nvariations in abundances which are correlated to variations in star formation\nhistories. The alpha-elements suggest that dSph chemical evolution has not been\naffected by very high mass stars (>15-20 Msun). The abundance patterns we\nmeasure for stars in dwarf spheroidal galaxies are significantly different from\nthose typically observed in the disk, bulge and inner-halo of our Galaxy. This\nsuggests that it is NOT possible to construct a significant fraction of our\nGalaxy from STARS formed in these dwarf spheroidal galaxies which subsequently\nmerged into our own. Any merger scenario involving dSph has to occur in the\nvery early Universe whilst they are still gas rich, so the majority of mass\ntransfer is gas, and few stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2002 19:32:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-23"}

In this paper, we\npropose a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method to deal with cosmic\nvariance and noise using synthetic spectra of quasistellar objects (QSOs) from\nour cosmological hydrodynamic simulations.

In such cases an oblate cloud\ncollapses to a structure composed of an outer thin disk and a central prolate\ncomponent. A prolate cloud, on the other hand, becomes a thin cigar-shape\nstructure with a central dense oblate component. The reversal of shape in the\ncentral part of the cooled clouds is due to supersonic motions either along the\ndisk plane in the case of oblate clouds or along the symmetry axis in the case\nof prolate clouds.

This formalism offers a\nunified description of cosmic strings, including the case for which they carry\ninternal currents, and allows the study of their cosmological evolution, and\nimplications, by means of numerical simulations. Its validity has already been\nconfirmed for cosmic string carrying bosonic currents, and the third part\nprovides new results concerning the fermionic currents case. First, the fermion\nmass spectrum in a cosmic string is computed, and suggests that fermionic\ncurrents are usually built on massive propagation modes leading to a new\nequation of state. This highlights that the usual one parameter macroscopic\nformalism is not always sufficient in case of fermionic currents. Moreover,\ncontrary to the bosonic case, the dynamics stemming from this equation of state\nexhibits transitions between the subsonic and supersonic regimes whose\nconsequences in cosmology could be important. The last part is an extension of\nthese results to brane cosmology for which our universe is viewed as a four\ndimensional domain wall embedded in a five dimensional space-time. In the\nframework of the Randall-Sundrum model, the masses of the trapped fermions on\nthe brane can be predicted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Nov 2002 02:19:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}
