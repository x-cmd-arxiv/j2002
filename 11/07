This is the most natural outcome of\nsupranova model where initially a supernova explosion takes place, leaving a\nsupra-massive NS, which loses its rotational energy over a time t_sd and\ncollapses to a BH, triggering a GRB explosion. We find that the time delay t_sd\nbetween the supernova and GRB events is the most important parameter that\ndetermines the behavior of the system. We consider the afterglow, prompt GRB\nand direct emission from the PWB. The observational signatures for different\nt_sd are described and joined together into one coherent framework. Constraints\non the model are derived for a spherical PWB, from the lack of detection of the\nPWB emission and afterglow observations. For very low values of t_sd<1 hr the\nsupranova model reduces to the collapsar model; 0.4<t_sd/1yr<1 is required to\nproduce the iron lines seen in some X-ray afterglows. However, we find that for\na spherical PWB, this implies no detectable radio afterglow, a small jet break\ntime and non-relativistic transition time, in disagreement with observations\nfor some of these GRBs. These discrepancies with the observations may be\nreconciled by resorting to a non-spherical geometry. We find that light element\nlines, recently detected in a few X-ray afterglows, are expected to dominate\nover iron lines for small t_sd, while for large t_sd the situation is reversed.\nFinally, we predict that external Compton scattering of the PWB photons by the\nafterglow relativistic electrons, should lead to high energy emission during\nthe early afterglow that may explain the GeV photons detected by EGRET in some\nGRBs, and should be detectable by future missions (GLAST).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Nov 2002 04:02:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This\ncriterion is a discriminative version of the principal curve proposed by Hastie\net al. The criterion is appropriate in particular when the input space is\nalready a well-designed feature space with rather small dimensionality. The\ndefinition of the margin is generalized in order to represent prior knowledge.\nThe derived algorithm consists of two alternating steps to estimate the dual\nparameters. Firstly, the parameters are initialized by the original SVM. Then\none set of parameters is updated by Newton-like procedure, and the other set is\nupdated by solving a quadratic programming problem. The algorithm converges in\na few steps to a local optimum under mild conditions and it preserves the\nsparsity of support vectors. Although the complexity to calculate temporal\nvariables increases the complexity to solve the quadratic programming problem\nfor each step does not change. It is also shown that the original SVM can be\nseen as a special case. We further derive a simplified algorithm which enables\nus to use the existing code for the original SVM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Nov 2002 06:44:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It extends to scaling the method introduced by Bertotti\nand the author to create a fully relational dynamics that satisfies Mach's\nprinciple. The method is illustrated here in the context of non-relativistic\ngravitational particle dynamics.. It leads to far stronger predictions than\ngeneral Newtonian dynamics. The energy and angular momentum of an `island\nuniverse' must be exactly zero and its size, measured by its moment of inertia,\ncannot change. This constancy is enforced because the scale invariance requires\nall potentials to be homogeneous of degree -2. It is remarkable that one can\nnevertheless exactly recover the standard observed Newtonian laws and forces,\nwhich are merely accompanied by an extremally weak universal force like the one\ndue to Einstein's cosmological constant. In contrast to Newtonian and\nEinsteinian dynamics, both the gravitational constant G and the strength of the\ncosmological force are uniquely determined by the matter distribution of the\nuniverse. Estimates of their values in agreement with observations are\nobtained. Best matching implements a dynamics of pure shape for which the\naction is a dimensionless number. If the universe obeys such scale invariant\nlaw, steadily increasing inhomogeneity, not expansion of the universe, causes\nthe Hubble red shift.

Particularly interesting is the density dependence of the\nequation of state (EOS). For example, the softening of the EOS at high density,\nwhere the pressure rises slower than anticipated, could signal a transition to\nan exotic phase. However, extracting the density dependence of the EOS requires\nmeasuring the radii of neutron stars for a broad range of masses. A ``normal''\n1.4 solar mass neutron star has a central density of a few times nuclear-matter\nsaturation density. In contrast, low mass (of the order of 0.5 solar masses)\nneutron stars have central densities near nuclear-matter saturation density so\nits radius provides information on the EOS at low density. Unfortunately,\nlow-mass stars are rare because they may be hard to form. Instead, a precision\nmeasurement of nuclear radii on atomic nuclei may contain similar information.\nIndeed, we find a strong correlation between the neutron radius of 208Pb and\nthe radius of a 0.5 solar-mass neutron star. Thus, the radius of such a neutron\nstar can be inferred from a measurement of the the neutron radius of 208Pb.\nComparing this value to the measured radius of a 1.4 solar-mass neutron star\nshould provide the strongest constraint to date on the density dependence of\nthe equation of state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Nov 2002 16:24:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

When data consistent with its\nderivation are analyzed without imposition of the stationarity assumption, the\nresulting correlations satisfy the Bell inequality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Nov 2002 20:05:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Atoms are cooled and trapped in a modified\nmagneto-optical trap (MOT) consisting of a conventional 2D-MOT in radial\ndirection and an axial molasses. The radial magnetic field gradient needed for\nthe operation of the 2D-MOT is provided by the IP trap. A small axial curvature\nand offset field provide magnetic confinement and suppress spin-flip losses in\nthe center of the magnetic trap without altering the performance of the 2D-MOT.\nContinuous loading of atoms into the IP trap is provided by radiative leakage\nfrom the MOT to a metastable level which is magnetically trapped and decoupled\nfrom the MOT light. We are able to accumulate 30 times more atoms in the\nmagnetic trap than in the MOT. The absolute number of $2\\times 10^8$~atoms is\nlimited by inelastic collisions. A model based on rate equations shows good\nagreement with our data. Our scheme can also be applied to other atoms with\nsimilar level structure like alkaline earth metals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Nov 2002 20:41:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
