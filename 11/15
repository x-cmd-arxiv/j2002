The surface brightness profile is very well\napproximated by the superposition of an R^{1/4} spheroid and an exponential\ndisk. The surface brightness profile is remarkably similar to that of Sab\ngalaxy UGC615, but the simulated galaxy rotates significantly faster and has a\ndeclining rotation curve dominated by the spheroid near the center. The decline\nin circular velocity is at odds with observation and results from the high\nconcentration of the dark matter and baryonic components, as well as from the\nrelatively high mass-to-light ratio of the stars in the simulation. The\nsimulated galaxy lies ~ 1 mag off the I-band Tully-Fisher relation of late-type\nspirals, but seems to be in reasonable agreement with Tully-Fisher data on S0\ngalaxies. The angular momentum of the luminous component is an order of\nmagnitude lower than that of late-type spirals of similar rotation speed.

We explore how the metallicity\ndistribution of the parent enrichment events f(z_0) drives the SIM and\npredictions for the Population III fraction. The SIM shows that the\npreviously-identified \"high halo\" and \"low halo\" populations are consistent\nwith a continuous evolutionary progression, and therefore may not necessarily\nbe physically distinct populations. Possible evolutionary scenarios for halo\nevolution are discussed within the SIM's simplistic one-zone paradigm.\n  The values of z_0 depend strongly on metal dispersal processes, thus we\ninvestigate interstellar mixing and mass transport, for the first time\nexplicitly incorporating this into a semi-analytic chemical evolution model.\nDiffusion is found to be inefficient for all phases, including the hot phase,\nof the interstellar medium (ISM): relevant diffusion lengths are 2 - 4 orders\nof magnitude smaller than corresponding length scales for turbulent mixing.\nRough relations for dispersal processes are given for multiphase ISM. These\nsuggest that the expected low-metallicity threshold above zero is consistent\nwith the currently observed limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2002 21:41:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Generally, the 't Hooft ansatz is no longer a solution of the Yang-Mills\nfield equation in the presence of external fields. Therefore, we investigate a\nstabilized instanton solution with minimal total Yang-Mills action in a\nnontrivial topological sector. With this aim, we consider numerical\nminimization of the action with respect to the global color orientation, the\nanisotropic scale transformation and the local gauge-like transformation\nstarting from a simple superposed gauge field of the 't Hooft ansatz and the\nexternal color field. Here, the external color field is, for simplicity, chosen\nto be a constant Abelian magnetic field along a certain direction. Then, the\n4-dimensional rotational symmetry O(4) of the instanton solution is reduced to\ntwo 2-dimensional rotational symmetries $O(2)\\times O(2)$ due to the effect of\na homogeneous external field. In the space $\\mib{R}^{3}$ at fixed $t$, we find\na quadrupole deformation of this instanton solution.

We find that color\nsuperconducting quark matter will occur in compact stars at values of the bag\nconstant where ordinary quark matter would not be allowed. We are able to\nconstruct ``hybrid'' stars with a color superconducting quark matter interior\nand nuclear matter surface, with masses in the range 1.3-1.6 M_solar and radii\n8-11 km. Our results are consistent with recent mass-radius limits based on\nabsorption lines from EXO0748-676.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2002 19:01:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2002 10:09:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The four cotectic concentrations and the\nfour corresponding seismic discontinuity radii have been used to show that the\nsilicon concentration as a function of the distance R from the centre of the\nEarth can be modelled by C(Si) = G(R/Re)(R/Re) where G = 0.583, Re is the\nEarth's radius and the Ni/Fe ratio is 0.072.
