These indices can be defined for any given matrix. They are\nespecially important for matrices describing many-body systems, equilibrium as\nwell as nonequilibrium, for which the indices present a quantitative measure of\nthe level of ordering. They characterize not only the long-range order, but\nalso mid-range order. In the latter case, when order parameters do not exist,\nthe matrix indices are well defined, providing an explicit classification of\nvarious mid-range orders. The matrix order indices are suitable for describing\nphase transitions with both off-diagonal and diagonal order. Contrary to order\nparameters whose correct definition requires the thermodynamic limit, the\nmatrix indices do not necessarily need the latter. Because of this, such\nindices can distinguish between different phases of finite systems, thus,\nallowing for the classification of crossover phase transitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2002 11:05:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
