Recently, multiply deuterated\nspecies have been detected, e.g. ND3, in cold dense regions of the interstellar\nmedium.

This would be the mechanism for the large dispersion of [D]/[H]\nvalues found in the interstellar medium. Light molecules (hydrides and\ndeuterides) generally have large fundamental rotation frequencies, often lying\nin the HIFI bands. The deuterides are a specially suitable case, because the\nspecies exist mainly in cold dense regions, where the molecules are in the\nground states and THz observations will best be carried out by absorption\nspectroscopy against background dust continuum sources such as Sgr B2 and W49N.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Nov 2002 20:06:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Particles travel freely and are scattered off\ninto random directions when they hit the fractal. The statistical distribution\nof the flight increments (i.e. of the displacements between two consecutive\nhittings) is analytically derived from a common, practical definition of\nfractal dimension, and it turns out to approximate quite well a power-law in\nthe case where the dimension D of the fractal is less than 2, there is though\nalways a finite rate of unaffected escape. Random walks through fractal sets\nwith D less or equal 2 can thus be considered as defective Levy walks. The\ndistribution of jump increments for D > 2 is decaying exponentially. The\ndiffusive behavior of the random walk is analyzed in the frame of continuous\ntime random walk, which we generalize to include the case of defective\ndistributions of walk-increments. It is shown that the particles undergo\nanomalous, enhanced diffusion for D_F < 2, the diffusion is dominated by the\nfinite escape rate. Diffusion for D_F > 2 is normal for large times, enhanced\nthough for small and intermediate times. In particular, it follows that\nfractals generated by a particular class of self-organized criticality (SOC)\nmodels give rise to enhanced diffusion. The analytical results are illustrated\nby Monte-Carlo simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Nov 2002 19:34:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
