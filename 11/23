First, it has been possible to demonstrate\nthat a large part of the electromagnetic emission observed can be interpreted\nas arising from the jet; this explains at once all spectral features and their\nvariability. Second we dwell on the concept that merging galaxies naturally\nlead to merging Black Holes. Here we emphasize two aspects: a) the torque\nexerted by the binary Black Holes carves a torus like distribution out of the\nstellar population near to the Black Hole binary; b) We consider the last\nstages of the Black Hole binary merger, taking into account the angle between\nthe spin of the primary Black Hole, and the orbital spin of the second Black\nHole. We show that the loss of orbital angular momentum is very strongly\nspin-dependent; for large angles between the two spins the angular momentum\nloss is strongly inhibited, allowing spin flip of the primary Black Hole which\npreserves a high angular momentum relative to the maximum allowed. This ensures\nthat both before and after the merger the accretion disk may reach to very\nsmall distances from the central Black Hole, with very high local temperatures\nright near the base of the jet: This is especially interesting in the case that\nforming the jet requires the formation of an ADAF like ring near the inner edge\nof the disk, as suggested by some earlier work. It also may have consequences\nfor the initial hadronic interactions right near the base of the jet. Finally,\nthis may also have important implications for the discovery of gravitational\nradiation bursts from the merger of black holes; the spin dependence needs to\nbe taken into account.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Nov 2002 16:19:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Nov 2002 13:09:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
