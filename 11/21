Most of the radio galaxies have rounder, more symmetric\nmorphologies at rest-frame optical wavelengths. Here we show the most direct\nevidence that in most cases the stellar hosts are normal elliptical galaxies\nwith de Vaucouleurs law light profiles. For a few galaxies very faint traces of\nthe UV-bright aligned component are also visible in the infrared images. We\nderive both the effective radius and surface-brightness for nine of eleven\nsample galaxies by fitting surface-brightness models to them. We find their\nsizes are similar to those of local FRII radio source hosts and are in general\nlarger than other local galaxies. The derived host galaxy luminosities are very\nhigh and lie at the bright end of luminosity functions constructed at similar\nredshifts. The galaxies in our sample are also brighter than the rest-frame\nsize--surface-brightness locus defined by the low-redshift sources. Passive\nevolution roughly aligns the z ~ 1 galaxies with the low-redshift samples. The\noptical host is sometimes centered on a local minimum in the rest-frame UV\nemission, suggesting the presence of substantial dust obscuration. We also see\ngood evidence of nuclear point sources in three galaxies. Overall, our results\nare consistent with the hypothesis that these galaxies have already formed the\nbulk of their stars at redshifts greater than z >~ 2, and that the AGN\nphenomenon takes place within otherwise normal, perhaps passively evolving,\ngalaxies.

Thus, the f-electron state at each site is\nlabelled by $\\mu$, namely, the z-component of total angular momentum j. By\npaying due attention to f-orbital symmetry, the hopping amplitudes between\nf-electron states are expressed using Slater's integrals. The Coulomb\ninteraction terms among the $\\mu$-states are written by Slater-Condon or Racah\nparameters. Finally, the CEF terms are obtained from the table of Hutchings.\nThe constructed Hamiltonian is regarded as an orbital degenerate Hubbard model,\nsince it includes two pseudo-spin and three pseudo-orbital degrees of freedom.\nFor practical purposes, it is further simplified into a couple of two-orbital\nmodels by discarding one of the three orbitals.

A\nformal trace is defined by summing the product of the weight and the Lefschetz\nsign over all fixed points of all the diffeos. This yields a formal\nRuelle-Lefschetz determinant Det^#(1-zM). We use the Milnor-Ruelle-Kitaev\nequality (recently proved by Baillif), which expressed Det^#(1-zM) as an\nalternated product of determinants of kneading operators,Det(1+D_k(z)), to\nrelate zeroes and poles of the Ruelle-Lefschetz determinant to the spectra of\nthe transfer operators M_k. As an application, we get a new proof of a theorem\nof Ruelle on smooth expanding dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2002 15:01:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Apr 2003 14:46:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 21 Jun 2004 16:39:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
