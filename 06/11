The\nnotion of Galois fields (which is extremely simple and elegant) is discussed in\ndetail and we also discuss the conditions when our description gives the same\npredictions as the conventional one. In quantum theory based on a Galois field,\nall operators are well defined and divergencies cannot not exist in principle.\nA particle and its antiparticle are described by the same modular irreducible\nrepresentation of the symmetry algebra. This automatically explains the\nexistence of antiparticles and shows that a particle and its antiparticle are\nthe different states of the same object. As a consequence, a new symmetry\narises, and the structure of the theory is considerably simplified. In\nparticular, one can work with only creation operators or only annihilation ones\nsince they are no more independent. In our approach the problem arises whether\nthe existence of neutral elementary particles (e.g. the photon) is compatible\nwith the usual relation between spin and statistics, or in other words whether\nneutral particles can be elementary or only composite.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jun 2002 18:15:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Unlike previous tests of nonlocality, the interference involves\ncontinuous variables, momentum and position. Interference can only occur if the\nwave function retains amplitudes for all possible decays. The interference can\nbe studied through the transverse momentum spectrum of the reconstructed\nmesons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jun 2002 01:20:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Jan 2003 19:49:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

In this paper we describe a procedure for\nderiving the map between physical and effective channels that results from a\ngiven coding and recovery procedure. We show that the map for a concatenation\nof codes is given by the composition of the maps for the constituent codes.\nThis perspective leads to an efficient means for calculating the exact\nperformance of quantum codes with arbitrary levels of concatenation. We present\nexplicit results for single-bit Pauli channels. For certain codes under the\nsymmetric depolarizing channel, we use the coding maps to compute exact\nthreshold error probabilities for achievability of perfect fidelity in the\ninfinite concatenation limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jun 2002 07:37:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
