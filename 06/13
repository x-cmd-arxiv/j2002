Based on analytic arguments and numerical\nsimulations of the hydrodynamical evolution of a spiral galaxy's halo gas\n(which is a likely candidate for the source of gas replenishment for star\nformation in spirals), we show that the origin of passive spirals may well be\nassociated with halo gas stripping.

Furthermore, our study demonstrates that this\ndramatic decline in the gaseous infall rate leads to a steady increase in the\n$Q$ parameter for the disk, with the spiral arm structure, although persisting,\nbecoming less pronounced as the star formation rate gradually decreases.

We observe three different regimes, depending on\nthe value of these two parameters: an oscillating phase with bubbles and\ncrashes, an intermittent phase and a stable `rational' market phase. The\nstatistics of price changes in the intermittent phase resembles that of real\nprice changes, with small linear correlations, fat tails and long range\nvolatility clustering. We discuss how the time dependence of these two\nparameters spontaneously drives the system in the intermittent region. We\nanalyze quantitatively the temporal correlation of activity in the intermittent\nphase, and show that the `random time strategy shift' mechanism that we\nproposed earlier allows one to understand the observed long ranged\ncorrelations. Other mechanisms leading to long ranged correlations are also\nreviewed. We discuss several other issues, such as the formation of bubbles and\ncrashes, the influence of transaction costs and the distribution of agents\nwealth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2002 09:48:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Jul 2002 07:55:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

B) Ashtekar and Lewandowski suggested a\nnon-Abelean generalization of Varadarajan's states to QGR which, however, are\nno longer of the complexifier type. We construct a new class of non-Abelean\ncomplexifiers which come close to the one underlying Varadarajan's\nconstruction. C) Non-Abelean complexifiers close to Varadarajan's induce new\ntypes of Hilbert spaces which do not support the operator algebra of QGR. The\nanalysis suggests that if one sticks to the present kinematical framework of\nQGR and if kinematical coherent states are at all useful, then normalizable,\ngraph dependent states must be used which are produced by the complexifier\nmethod as well. D) Present proposals for states with mildened graph dependence,\nobtained by performing a graph average, do not approximate well coordinate\ndependent observables. However, graph dependent states, whether averaged or\nnot, seem to be well suited for the semiclassical analysis of QGR with respect\nto coordinate independent operators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2002 11:19:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}

Our starting\npoint is the assumption that off-diagonal CKM mixing matrix elements are\ndirectly related by lowest order perturbation theory to the quark mass\nmatrices. This appears to be most easily and naturally implemented by assuming\nthat all off-diagonal elements reside in the down-quark mass matrix. This\nassumption is in turn naturally realized by introducing three generations of\nheavy, electroweak-singlet down quarks which couple to the Higgs sector\ndiagonally in flavor, while mass-mixing off-diagonally with the light\ndown-quarks. Anomaly cancellation then naturally leads to inclusion of\nelectroweak vector-doublet leptons. It is then only a short step to completing\nthe extension to three generations of fundamental representations of E(6).\nAssuming only that the third generation B couples to the Higgs sector at least\nas strongly as does the top quark, the mass of the B is roughly estimated to\nlie between 1.7 TeV and 10 TeV, with lower-generation quarks no heavier. The\ncorresponding guess for the new leptons is a factor two lower. Within the\nvalidity of the model, flavor and CP violation are ``infrared'' in nature,\ninduced by semi-soft mass mixing terms, not Yukawa couplings.

A previously ignored mechanism (gas\nin--homogeneity which is negligible in the thermal mobilities for He and other\ngases) is found to reproduce the observed Neon mobilities accurately and simply\nat five temperatures with just one variable parameter. Recognizing that a gas\nis not a homogeneous medium, a variation in local density combined with the\nquantum multi--scattering theory, shifts the energy and cross section -- which\nin turn changes the collision probability and finally the mobilities. A lower\ndensity where a momentum transfer interaction occurs moves the mobility\nstrongly in the same direction as the anomalous experiments. By going backwards\nfrom the observed mobilities, the collision frequency at each temperature and\ndensity is made to reproduce the experimental data by looking for the local (as\nopposed to average) density at which the (rare) momentum transfer interactions\noccur. These density deviations give a picture of the size and behavior of the\nwave packets for electron motion which looks very much like the often discussed\nwave function collapse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2002 11:30:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
