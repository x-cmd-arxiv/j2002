We use an ideal gas e.o.s., and assume that all\nthe dissipated energy is radiated away. The disks evolve due to viscous\nstresses, modeled with an alpha law. We study the disk structure, and the\nstrong meridional circulations that are established and persist throughout our\ncalculations. These consist of strong outflows along the equatorial plane that\nreverse direction close to the surface of the disk and converge on the\naccretor. In the context of GRBs, we estimate the energy released from the\nsystem in neutrinos and through magnetic-dominated mechanisms, and find it can\nbe as high as 10^52 erg and 10^51 erg respectively, during an estimated\ntimescale of 0.1-0.2 seconds. neutrino-anti neutrino annihilation is likely to\nproduce bursts from only an impulsive energy input (the annihilation luminosity\nscales as t^(-5/2)) and so would be unable to account for a large fraction of\nbursts with complicated light curves. However a gas mass ~0.1-0.25 Msun\nsurvives in the orbiting debris, enabling strong magnetic fields (~10^16 Gauss)\nto be anchored in the dense matter long enough to power short GRBs. We also\ninvestigate the continuous energy injection that arises as the black hole\nslowly swallows the rest of the disk and discuss its consequences on the GRB\nafterglow emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Jun 2002 18:09:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

By extending our theory to general situations, we\nexamined the EM-T diagram in detail, and found the following properties: 1) The\nuniversal correlation sequence (``main sequence flares'') with $EM \\propto\nT^{17/2}$ corresponds to the case of constant heating flux or equivalently the\ncase of constant magnetic field strength in the reconnection model. 2) The EM-T\ndiagram has a forbidden region, where gas pressure of flares exceeds magnetic\npressure. 3) There is a coronal branch with $EM \\propto T^{15/2}$ for $T< 10^7$\nK, and $EM \\propto T^{13/2}$ for $T> 10^7$ K.

These\nindex-color diagrams follow the common convention of presenting stars with\nhighest abundance at the bottom of the plot although the index values for the\nmetal-rich stars are numerically larger. For field F dwarfs in the range [Fe/H]\nbetween +0.4 and -1.0, [Fe/H] = -5.6 delta-hk + 0.125, with no evidence for a\ncolor dependence in the slope. For the G and K dwarfs, the Hyades mean relation\ncrosses the field star distribution in the two-color diagram, defining an\napproximate UPPER bound for the local disk stars. Stars found above the Hyades\nstars fall in at least one of three categories: [Fe/H] below -0.7, [Fe/H] above\nthat of the Hyades, or chromospherically active. It is concluded that, contrary\nto the predictions of model atmospheres, the hk index for cool dwarfs at a\ngiven color hits a maximum value for stars below solar composition and, with\nincreasing [Fe/H] above some critical value, declines. This trend is\nconsistent, however, with the predictions from synthetic indices based upon\nmuch narrower Ca filters where the crossover is caused by the metallicity\nsensitivity of b-y.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jun 2002 15:33:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Electroinjected e-h pairs are simulated by a mixed quantum\nstate, which relaxes via phonon-driven internal conversions to low-lying\ncharge-transfer (CT) and excitonic (XT) states. The underlying two-band polymer\nmodel reflects PPV and spans monoexcited configuration interaction singlets (S)\nand triplets (T), coupled to Franck-Condon active C=C stretches and\nring-torsions. Focusing entirely upon long PPV chains, we consider the\nrecombination kinetics of an initially separated CT pair. Our model\ncalculations indicated that S and T recombination proceeds according to a\nbranched, two-step mechanism dictated by near e-h symmetry. The initial\nrelaxation occurs rapidly with nearly half of the population going into\nexcitons ($S_{XT}$ or $T_{XT}$), while the remaining portion remains locked in\nmetastable CT states. While formation rates of $S_{CT}$ and $T_{CT}$ are nearly\nequal, $S_{XT}$ is formed about twice as fast $T_{XT}$ in concurrence with\nexperimental observations of these systems.
