Using mid-infrared and far-infrared flux densities\nnormalized by K-band flux densities as indicators of recent star formation, we\nfind several trends. First, star formation activity is stronger in late-type\n(Sc - Scd) spirals than in early-type (Sa - Sab) spirals. This trend is seen\nboth in nuclear and disk activity. These results confirm several previous\noptical studies of star formation along the Hubble sequence but conflict with\nthe conclusions of most of the previous studies using IRAS data, and we discuss\nwhy this might be so. Second, star formation is significantly more extended in\nlater-type spirals than in early-type spirals. We suggest that these trends in\nstar formation are a result of differences in the gas content and its\ndistribution along the Hubble sequence, and it is these differences that\npromote star formation in late-type spiral galaxies. We also search for trends\nin nuclear star formation related to the presence of a bar or nuclear activity.\nThe nuclear star formation activity is not significantly different between\nbarred and unbarred galaxies. We do find that star formation activity appears\nto be inhibited in LINERs and transition objects compared to HII galaxies. The\nmean star formation rate in the sample is 1.4 Msun/yr based on global\nfar-infrared fluxes. Combining these data with CO data gives a mean gas\nconsumption time of 6.4 x 10^8 yr, which is ~5 times lower than the values\nfound in other studies. Finally, we find excellent support for the Schmidt Law\nin the correlation between molecular gas masses and recent star formation in\nthis sample of spiral galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jun 2002 02:40:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2002 02:41:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

We claim that since the number of tunneling electrons in a single precessing\nperiod is small (~20) one may expect a net temporary polarization within this\nperiod that will couple via exchange interaction to the localized spin. This\ncoupling will randomly modulate the tunneling barrier and create a dispersion\nin the tunneling current which is a product of a Larmor frequency component due\nto the precession of the single spin and the dispersion of the spin of the\ntunneling electrons.

The toroidal field B_t tends to\ndistort the NS into a prolate shape, and this magnetic distortion can easily\ndominate over the oblateness ``frozen into'' the NS crust. An elastic NS with\nfrozen-in B-field of this magnitude is clearly secularly unstable: the wobble\nangle between the NS's angular momentum J^i and the star's magnetic axis n_B^i\ngrow on a dissipation timescale until J^i and n_B^i are orthogonal. This final\norientation is clearly the optimal one for gravitational-wave (gw) emission.\nThe basic cause of the instability is quite general, so we conjecture that the\nsame final state is reached for a realistic NS. Assuming this, we show that for\nLMXB's with B_t of order 10^{13}G, the spindown from gw's is sufficient to\nbalance the accretion torque--supporting a suggestion by Bildsten. The spindown\nrates of most millisecond pulsars can also be attributed to gw emission sourced\nby toroidal B-fields, and both these sources could be observed by LIGO II.\nWhile the first-year spindown of a newborn NS is most likely dominated by em\nprocesses, reasonable values of B_t and the (external) dipolar field B_d can\nlead to detectable levels of gw emission, for a newborn NS in our own galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jun 2002 12:58:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Aug 2002 11:37:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Therefore, for\nconsistency, an accelerated charge, free from the influence of external forces,\nshould gradually lose its acceleration, until its total energy is radiated.\nCalculations show that the self force of a charge, which compensates for its\nradiation, is proportional to the derivative of the acceleration. However, when\nusing this self-force in the equation of motion of the charge, one gets a\ndiverging solution, for which the acceleration runs away to infinity. This\nmeans that there is an inconsistency in the solution of the single charge\nproblem. However, in the construction of the conserved Maxwell charge density,\nthere is implicitly an integral over the corresponding world line which\ncorresponds to a collection of charged spacetime events. One may therefore\nconsistently think of the ``self force'' as the force on a charge due to\nanother charge at the retarded position. From this point of view, the energy is\nevidently conserved and the radiation process appears as an absorbing\nresistance to the feeding source. The purpose of this work is to learn about\nthe behavior of single charges from the behavior of a real current,\ncorresponding to the set of chargesa moving on a world line, and to study the\nanalog of the self force of a charge associated with the radiation resistance\nof a continuum of charges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jun 2002 09:12:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
