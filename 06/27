Such an almost\naxisymmetric model undergoes an early evolutionary phase of secular timescale,\nwith moment of inertia along the spin axis, I_{zz}=I_{33}, greater than the\nmoments of inertia along the equatorial axes, I_{11}=I_{22}, since rotation and\npoloidal field (both deriving oblate configurations) dominate over the toroidal\nfield (deriving prolate configurations). During this phase, the model suffers\nfrom secular angular momentum loss due to weak magnetic dipole radiation\nactivated by the poloidal field, leading gradually to \"dynamical asymmetry\"\nwith I_{11}>I_{33}. However, a dynamically asymmetric configuration tends to\nturn over spontaneously, i.e., to rotate about axis with moment of inertia\ngreater than I_{33}, with angular momentum remaining invariant. So, the fate of\na dynamically asymmetric configuration is to become an oblique rotator and,\neventually, a perpendicular rotator.

This was attributed to matter ejected from a\nmassive stellar progenitor occurring shortly before the burst itself. Here, we\npresent a detailed re-analysis of the XMM-Newton EPIC observations of GRB\n011211. In particular, we show that the detection of the soft X-ray line\nemission appears robust, regardless of detector background, calibration,\nspectral binning, or the spectral model that is assumed. We demonstrate that\nthermal emission, from an optically thin plasma, is the most plausible model\nthat can account for the soft X-ray emission, which appears to be the case for\nat least two burst afterglow spectra observed by XMM-Newton. The X-ray spectrum\nof GRB 011211 evolves with time over the first 12 ksec of the XMM-Newton\nobservation, the observations suggest that thermal emission dominates the early\nafterglow spectrum, whilst a power-law component dominates the latter stages.\nFinally we estimate the mass of the ejected material in GRB 011211 to be of the\norder 4-20 solar masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2002 13:45:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The s-density-wave state, the d-density-wave state, and the D-Mott\nstate are also known as the charge-density-wave (CDW) state, the staggered-flux\n(SF) state, and the rung-singlet state, respectively.

Based on the effective theory\nbelow the reduced cutoff scale on the brane, we formulate the Schwinger-Dyson\nequation of the brane fermion propagator. By using the improved ladder\napproximation we numerically solve the Schwinger-Dyson equation and find that\nthe dynamical fermion mass is near the reduced cutoff scale on the brane for\nthe flat brane world with delta >= 3 and for the RS brane world. In RS brane\nworld KK excited modes of the bulk gauge field localized around the y = pi R\nbrane and it enhances the dynamical symmetry breaking on the brane. The decay\nconstant of the fermion and the anti-fermion composite operator can be taken to\nbe the order of the electroweak scale much smaller than the Planck scale.\nTherefore electroweak mass scale can be realized from only the Planck scale in\nthe RS brane world due to the fermion and the anti-fermion pair condensation.\nThat is a dynamical realization of Randall-Sundrum model which solves the\nweak-Planck hierarchy problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2002 09:03:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2002 15:39:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Starting from first order,\nfree terms (solutions of the unperturbed equations) emerge in every order in\nthe expansion of the approximate solution. In orders higher than first, the\namplitudes of these free terms appear in the solvability conditions. Contrary\nto the common belief, in the MMTS analysis, these free terms play a role above\nand beyond the satisfaction of initial conditions: They make feasible mutual\nconsistency among solvability conditions that arise in different orders. In\ngeneral, this consistency may not be ensured if the free terms are chosen\narbitrarily (e.g., set to zero, as is commonly done in many applications). If\nconsistency is not ensured, the analysis may lead to wrong results, or allow\nonly trivial solutions.\n  The solvability conditions constitute a system of PDE's for the dependence of\nthe amplitudes that appear in the expansion on the slow time scales. However,\nwhenever the free amplitudes must be included to ensure a consistent expansion,\nthese PDE's cannot determine the dependence of the solution on slow time\nvariables beyond the first one, T1=epsilo*t. The dependence on slower time\nscales, Tn=epsilon^n*t, n > 1, must be imposed either through initial data at,\nsay, T1 = 0, or through requirements on the structure of the approximate\nsolution (based, for example, on physical intuition) that are not related to\nthe validity of the perturbative scheme.\n  These claims are illustrated through several simple examples, and then\ndiscussed in the general case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2002 07:58:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Jul 2002 08:03:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Moreover, such transitions can enhance the entropy production\nsignificantly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2002 08:35:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Spooky nonlocal state reduction is the most, and\nperhaps the only irrational feature of present day physics. There are\nexperimental results that reject nonlocal state reduction at a distance. Also,\nthere are arguments that show that signal locality itself can be violated if\nthere is true nonlocal collapse of the wavefunction. The Bell's inequalities,\nthe violation of which polarized physicists in favour of nonlocality, arise not\ndue to nonlocality, but due to ignoring prior information on correlations\nencoded in the phase of local probability amplitudes. Here I discuss an\nexperiment involving particles entangled in energy and time variables that\nshows that there is no nonlocal state reduction during measurements on\nentangled particles. Quantum mechanics is inconsistent if it includes the\nconcept of wavefunction collapse as a physical process for entangled\nmulti-particle systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2002 14:58:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
