In\nparticular, the interesting and unusual gamma-ray burst GRB980425, thought to\nbe related to the radio supernova SN1998bw, is a possible link between the two\nclasses of objects. Analyzing the extensive radio emission data avaliable for\nSN1998bw, one can describe its time evolution within the well established\nframework available for the analysis of radio emission from supernovae. This\nthen allows relatively detailed description of a number of physical properties\nof the object. The radio emission can best be explained as the interaction of a\nmildly relativistic shock with a dense preexplosion stellar wind-established\ncircumstellar medium (CSM) that is highly structured both azimuthally, in\nclumps or filaments, and radially, with observed density enhancements. Because\nof its unusual characteristics for a Type Ib/c supernova, the relation of\nSN1998bw to GRB980425 is strengthened and suggests that at least some classes\nof GRBs originate in supernova (SN) massive star explosions. Thus, employing\nthe formalism for describing the radio emission from supernovae (SNe) and\nfollowing the link through SN1998bw/GRB980425, it is possible to model the\ngross properties of the radio and optical/infrared (OIR) emission from the\nhalf-dozen GRBs with extensive radio observations. From this we conclude that\nat least some members of the ``slow-soft'' class of GRBs can be attributed to\nthe explosion of a massive star in a dense, highly structured CSM that was\npresumably established by the preexplosion stellar system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 May 2002 16:19:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-13"}

This task has two parts; one is finding \"featured\nwords\" which describe an article best and the other is finding a match among\nthese words to user-defined search terms. There are two main independent\napproaches to achieve this task. The first one, using the concepts of\nsemantics, has been implemented partially. For more details see another paper\nof Marko et al., 2002. The second approach is reported in this paper. It is a\ntheoretical model based on using Neural Network (NN). Instead of using keywords\nor reading from the first few lines from papers/articles, the present model\ngives emphasis on extracting \"featured words\" from an article. Obviously we\npropose to exclude prepositions, articles and so on, that is, English words\nlike \"of, the, are, so, therefore, \" etc. from such a list. A neural model is\ntaken with its nodes pre-assigned energies. Whenever a match is found with\nfeatured words and userdefined search words, the node is fired and jumps to a\nhigher energy. This firing continues until the model attains a steady energy\nlevel and total energy is now calculated. Clearly, higher match will generate\nhigher energy; so on the basis of total energy, a ranking is done to the\narticle indicating degree of relevance to the user's interest. Another\nimportant feature of the proposed model is incorporating a semantic module to\nrefine the search words; like finding association among search words, etc. In\nthis manner, information retrieval can be improved markedly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Jun 2002 15:10:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

First, we explore how dissipation in the magneto-viscous boundary layer\n(MVBL) at the crust-core interface governs the damping of r-mode perturbations\nin the fluid interior. Two models are considered: one assuming an\nordinary-fluid interior, the other taking the core to consist of superfluid\nneutrons, type II superconducting protons, and normal electrons. We show,\nwithin our approximations, that no solution to the magnetohydrodynamic\nequations exists in the superfluid model when both the neutron and proton\nvortices are pinned. However, if just one species of vortex is pinned, we can\nfind solutions. When the neutron vortices are pinned and the proton vortices\nare unpinned there is much more dissipation than in the ordinary-fluid model,\nunless the pinning is weak. When the proton vortices are pinned and the neutron\nvortices are unpinned the dissipation is comparable or slightly less than that\nfor the ordinary-fluid model, even when the pinning is strong. We also find in\nthe superfluid model that relatively weak radial magnetic fields ~ 10^9 G (10^8\nK / T)^2 greatly affect the MVBL, though the effects of mutual friction tend to\ncounteract the magnetic effects. Second, we evolve our two models in time,\naccounting for accretion, and explore how the magnetic field strength, the\nr-mode saturation amplitude, and the accretion rate affect the cyclic evolution\nof these stars. If the r-modes control the spin cycles of accreting neutron\nstars we find that magnetic fields can affect the clustering of the spin\nfrequencies of low mass x-ray binaries (LMXBs) and the fraction of these that\nare currently emitting gravitational waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Jun 2002 03:53:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Sep 2002 23:45:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-17"}

We underline the incompatibility of the\nconceptions ascribed to space of field, and stage in modern theories, with\ndiffering roles for coordinates. We hence trace the non-locality difficulty to\nthe identification of the basis space of the wave function and physical space.\nAn interpretation of the wave function in which space loses its stage use at\nthe local level, and its physical (field) meaning is assigned to the wave\nfunction, can solve this difficulty. An application of this proposal implies a\nfield-equation extension based on a unified description of bosons and fermions\nable to provide new information on the standard model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 May 2002 22:40:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
