The relation is roughly linear (i.e. doubling the pulse lag in\nturn doubles the jet break time) and thus implies a simple relationship between\nthese quantities. We suggest that this correlation is due to variation among\nbursts of emitter Doppler factor. Specifically, an increased speed or decreased\nangle of velocity, with respect to the observed line-of-site, of burst ejecta\nwill result in shorter perceived pulse lags in GRBs as well as quicker\nevolution of the external shock of the afterglow to the time when the jet\nbecomes obvious, i.e. the jet-break time. Thus this observed variation among\nGRBs may result from a perspective effect due to different observer angles of a\nmorphologically homogeneous populations of GRBs.\n  Also, a conjecture is made that peak luminosities not only vary inversely\nwith burst timescale, but also are directly proportional to the spectral break\nenergy.

The interplay between Sudakov logs and\nrenormalons is clarified, and the necessity to resum the latter whenever power\ncorrections are non-negligible is emphasized. The presence of power-suppressed\nambiguities in the exponentiation kernel suggests that power corrections\nexponentiate as well.

Our approach allows the construction of symplectic point\nand orbit reduced spaces purely within the Poisson category under hypotheses\nthat do not necessarily imply the existence of a momentum map. We construct an\norbit reduction procedure for canonical actions on a Poisson manifold that\nexhibits an interesting interplay with the von Neumann condition previously\nintroduced by the author in his study of singular dual pairs. This condition\nensures that the orbits in the momentum space of the optimal momentum map (we\ncall them polar reduced spaces) admit a presymplectic structure that\ngeneralizes the Kostant--Kirillov--Souriau symplectic structure of the\ncoadjoint orbits in the dual of a Lie algebra. Using this presymplectic\nstructure, the optimal orbit reduced spaces are symplectic with a form that\nsatisfies a relation identical to the classical one obtained by Marle, Kazhdan,\nKostant, and Sternberg for free Hamiltonian actions on a symplectic manifold.\nIn the symplectic case we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the\npolar reduced spaces to be symplectic. In general, the presymplectic polar\nreduced spaces are foliated by symplectic submanifolds that are obtained\nthrough a generalization to the optimal context of the so called Sjamaar\nPrinciple, already existing in the theory of Hamiltonian singular reduction.

We demonstrate that this model does not\nsatisfactorily describe recent high-force stretching data. We instead propose a\nmodel (the Discrete Persistent Chain, or ``DPC'') that borrows features from\nboth the FJC and the Wormlike Chain, and show that it resembles the data more\nclosely. We find that most of the high-force behavior previously attributed to\nstretch elasticity is really a feature of the corrected entropic elasticity;\nthe true stretch compliance of single-stranded DNA is several times smaller\nthan that found by previous authors. Next we elaborate our model to allow\ncoexistence of two conformational states of DNA, each with its own stretch and\nbend elastic constants. Our model is computationally simple, and gives an\nexcellent fit through the entire overstretching transition of nicked,\ndouble-stranded DNA. The fit gives the first values for the elastic constants\nof the stretched state.
