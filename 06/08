A segregation between relaxed and\nnon-relaxed systems is present in each plane of these relations pointing out to\na significant component in their intrinsic scatter.

Detailed rotation curves are now known for more than a thousand\ngalaxies, revealing that they are not so flat in the outer parts, but rising\nfor late-types, and falling for early-types. A well established result now is\nthat most bright galaxies are not dominated by dark matter inside their optical\ndisks. Only for dwarfs and LSB (Low Surface Brightness galaxies) dark matter\nplays a dominant role in the visible regions. The 3D-shape of haloes are\ninvestigated through several methods, that will be discussed: polar rings,\nflaring of HI planes, X-ray isophotes.\n  It is not yet possible with rotation curves to know how far haloes extend,\nbut tentatives have been made. It will be shown that the dark matter appears to\nbe coupled to the gas in spirals and dwarfs, suggesting that dark baryons could\nplay the major role in rotation curves.

The ability to detect with high\nefficiency (>99%), and to distinguish the number of photons in a given time\ninterval is a very challenging technical problem with enormous potential\npay-offs in quantum communications and information processing. Our proposal\ndiverges from standard solid-state photo-detector technology by employing an\natomic vapor as the active medium, prepared in a specific quantum state using\nlaser radiation. The absorption of a photon will be aided by a dressing laser,\nand the presence or absence of an excited atom will be detected using the\n``cycling transition'' approach perfected for ion traps. By first incorporating\nan appropriate upconversion scheme, our method can be applied to a wide variety\nof optical wavelengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jun 2002 21:40:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

For a class of observables with matrix-valued Weyl symbols\nproportional to the identity matrix, the Weyl-Wigner-Moyal formalism is\nproposed. The evolution equations are found to coincide with their counterparts\nin relativistic quantum mechanics with non-local Hamiltonian. The difference\nbetween the theories is connected with peculiarities of the constraints on the\ninitial conditions. Effective increase in coherence between eigenstates of the\nHamiltonian is found. Relativistic coherent states that take into account a\nnon-trivial charge structure of the position and momentum operators and satisfy\nthe charge superselection rule are considered. On this basis, the entangled\ncoherent states are developed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jun 2002 22:05:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
