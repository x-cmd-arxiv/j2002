This produces a\nlimit on their distribution in the magnitude-surface brightness plane, such\nthat we do not observe dEs with high surface brightnesses but faint absolute\nmagnitudes.

The wavevector quantization rule\nfor the quasi-bound modes is derived and given a simple physical interpretation\nin terms of Fresnel reflection; quasi-bound modes are explictly constructed and\ncompared to numerical results. The effect of discrete symmetries of the\nresonator is analyzed and shown to give rise to quasi-degenerate multiplets;\nthe average splitting of these multiplets is calculated by methods from quantum\nchaos theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Jun 2002 00:08:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

The answer involves well\nknown results from Group Representation Theory and Random Matrix Theory. This\nquantum problem has a well known classical counterpart: given a uniform\nensemble of probability distributions $P=(P_1, P_2, ..., P_N)$ where the $P_j$\nare non-negative reals that sum to one, calculate the mean value over this\nprobability simplex of products of $P$ components. The answer to the classical\nproblem follows from an integral formula due to Dirichlet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jun 2002 16:54:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

For the case where the Hamiltonians commute, relevant to certain\nquantum nondemolition measurements, the entanglement between qubits 1 and 2 is\ncalculated explicitly for several classes of initial states and compared with\nthe case of noncommuting interaction Hamiltonians.
