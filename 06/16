We show that this is\nthe same as a \"Lie crossed module\": a pair of Lie groups G,H with a\nhomomorphism t: H -> G and an action of G on H satisfying two compatibility\nconditions.

The program does not simulate the unitary operations\ncarried out by a quantum computer but does faithfully mimic its output at the\ncrucial \"readout\" step of the order-finding process. The program reqires only\ntwo inputs from the user - the number to be factored (which can be up to 10\ndigits long) and the number of qubits to be used in the factoring (for which a\nhelpful hint is given). The program then returns a detailed history of all its\nattempts at factoring the number, beginning with its various unsuccessful\nattempts and ending with the final successful attempt that leads to the correct\nfactors. The structure of the simulation is described, a typical output\nproduced by it is shown, and the factors limiting its performance are\ndiscussed. The purpose of this simulation is to provide the user with some\n\"hands-on\" experience of how quantum factoring works on integers somewhat\nlarger than can be handled by today's quantum computers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Jun 2002 15:09:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
