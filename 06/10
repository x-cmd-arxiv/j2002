BI CCDs\npossess the same structure to those of FI CCDs. Since X-ray photons enter from\nthe back surface of the CCD, a primary charge cloud is formed far from the\nelectrodes. The primary charge cloud expands through diffusion process until it\nreaches the potential well that is just below the electrodes. Therefore, the\ndiffusion time for the charge cloud produced is longer than that in the FI CCD,\nresulting a larger charge cloud shape expected.\n  The mesh experiment enables us to specify the X-ray point of interaction with\na subpixel resolution. We then have measured a charge cloud shape produced in\nthe BI CCD. We found that there are two components of the charge cloud shape\nhaving different size: a narrow component and a broad component. The size of\nthe narrow component is $2.8-5.7 \\mu$m in unit of a standard deviation and\nstrongly depends on the attenuation length in Si of incident X-rays. The\nshorter the attenuation length of X-rays is, the larger the charge cloud\nbecomes. This result is qualitatively consistent with a diffusion model inside\nthe CCD. On the other hand, the size of the broad component is roughly constant\nof $\\simeq 13 \\mu$m and does not depend on X-ray energies. Judging from the\ndesign value of the CCD and the fraction of each component, we conclude that\nthe narrow component is originated in the depletion region whereas the broad\ncomponent is in the field-free region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jun 2002 02:41:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
