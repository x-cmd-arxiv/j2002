One of the key steps in this\nprocess is to recognize the roles that zeta functions play in various arenas\nusing transform methods. Other logical connections are provided by the the\nappearance of the Drinfeld associator, Hopf algebras, and techniques of\nconformal field theory and braid groups. These recurring themes are subtly\nlinked in a vast scheme of a logically woven tapestry.\n  An immediate application of this framework is to provide an answer to a\nquestion of Kontsevich regarding the appearance of Drinfeld type integrals and\nin particular, multiple zeta values in: a) Drinfeld's work on the KZ equation\nand the associator; b) Etingof-Kazhdan's quantization of Poisson-Lie algebras;\nc) Tamarkin's proof of formality theorems; d) Kontsevich's quantization of\nPoisson manifolds. Combinatorial arguments relating Feynman diagrams to Selberg\nintegrals, multiple zeta values, and finally Poisson manifolds provide an\nadditional step in this framework. Along the way, we provide additional insight\ninto the various papers and theorems mentioned above. This paper represents an\noverall introduction to work currently in progress. More details to follow. See\nour paper Math.QA/[ ] for a proof of the Connes Kreimer Conjecture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2002 19:43:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In other words, Feynman diagrams evaluate to\nMultiple Zeta Values in all cases. This proves a recent conjecture of\nConnes-Kreimer, and others including Broadhurst and Kontsevich.\n  The key step of our theorem is to present the Selberg integral as discussed\nin Terasoma [22] as a Functional from the Rooted Trees Operad to the Hopf\nalgebra of Multiple Zeta Values. This is a new construction which provides\nillumination to the relations between zeta values, associators, Feynman\ndiagrams and moduli spaces.\n  An immediate implication of our Main Theorem is that by applying Terasoma's\nresult and using the construction of our Selberg integral-rooted trees\nfunctional, we prove that the Hermitian matrix integral as discussed in Mulase\n[18] evaluates to a Multiple Zeta Value in all 3 cases:\n  Asymptotically, the Limit as N goes to infinity, and in general.\n  Furthermore, this construction provides for a positive resolution to\nGoncharov's conjecture (see [7] pg. 30).

T-geometry is a powerful tool for the microcosm\ninvestigations due to three its characteristic features: (1) Any geometric\nobject is defined in all T-geometries at once, because its definition does not\ndepend on the form of world function. (2) Language of T-geometry does not use\nexternal means of description such as coordinates and curves; it uses only\nprimordially geometrical concepts: subspaces and world function.
