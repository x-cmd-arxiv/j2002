The 0.2-10 keV\nspectral continuum can be well reproduced by a power-law at higher energies; we\ndetect a prominent Fe K-alpha emission line, with both broad and narrow\ncomponents, and a weaker emission line at 6.9 keV which is probably a\ncombination of Fe K-beta and Fe XXVI.

The wide range of iron states present in\nthe spectrum enables us to deduce the ionisation structure of the absorbing\nmedium.

This is as a result of the $K$\ndiscretization, a manifestation of the quantum confinement effect (QCE). The\npredicted relative viscosity of a confined superfluid has the characteristic\norder of magnitude of experimental data ($<10^{-6}$). Furthermore, we show that\nat the edges of the resulting energy gaps, the $\\N2(K)$ presents discontinuity.\nWhen its corresponding energy exceeds the (first) gap, the superfluid flow\nexhibits a critical velocity $v_c$. Our evaluation of $v_c(d)$ versus the\nchannel width $d$, constrained to satisfy energy conservation, is in good\nquantitative agreement with experimental data for channels with $d>10^{-6}$ m.\nMeanwhile, a sharp turn about $K\\propto$ $ v_c$ in $\\N2(K)$ resembles very well\nthat of the experimental overshoot data. For narrower channels of $d<10^{-6}$ m\n$\\le \\Lambda$ in which the phonon excitation picture becomes inadequate, we\ninstead represent the excitation in terms of single atoms with an effective\nmass, which yields a $v_c(d)$ in close agreement with experiment. Accordingly,\nthe reduction in the number of atomic states results in superfluidity.

Within a mean-field approximation, the well-known results of\nOdijk, Skolnick and Fixman are reproduced. Beyond mean-field, it is found that\ndensity correlations between counterions and thermal fluctuations reduce the\nstiffness of the chain, indicating an effective attraction between monomers for\nhighly charged chains and multivalent counterions. This attraction results in a\npossible mechanical instability (collapse), alluding to the phenomenon of DNA\ncondensation. In addition, we find that more counterions condense on slightly\nbent conformations of the chain than predicted by the Manning model for the\ncase of an infinite cylinder. Finally, our results are compared with previous\nmodels and experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2002 05:25:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Jun 2002 05:04:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2002 06:15:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Considering the\nlighter stop to be the next-to-lightest Standard Model superpartner, we analyze\nstop signatures associated with jets, photons and missing energy, which lead to\nsignals naturally larger than the associated SM backgrounds. We consider both\n2-body and 3-body decays of the top squarks and show that the reach of the\nTevatron can be significantly larger than that expected within either the\nstandard supergravity models or models of low-energy supersymmetry breaking in\nwhich the stop is the lightest SM superpartner. For a modest projection of the\nfinal Tevatron luminosity, L = 4 fb-1, stop masses of order 300 GeV are\naccessible at the Tevatron collider in both 2-body and 3-body decay modes. We\nalso consider the production and decay of ten degenerate squarks that are the\nsupersymmetric partners of the five light quarks. In this case we find that\ncommon squark masses up to 360 GeV are easily accessible at the Tevatron\ncollider, and that the reach increases further if the gluino is light.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jun 2002 21:20:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2002 18:28:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

In practice an experimenter has access to an output filtered\nthrough various electronic devices, rather than the microscopic states of the\ndetector. This introduces several imperfections into the measurement process,\nof which only inefficiency has previously been incorporated into quantum\ntrajectory theory. However, all electronic devices have finite bandwidths, and\nthe consequent delay in conveying the output signal to the observer implies\nthat the evolution of the conditional state of the quantum system must be\nnon-Markovian.
