There is also growing evidence that some\nGalactic globular clusters harbor black holes of similar mass, from\nobservations of stellar kinematics. In such high-density stellar environments,\nthe interactions of intermediate-mass black holes are promising sources of\ngravitational waves for ground-based and space-based detectors. Here we explore\nthe signal strengths of binaries containing intermediate-mass black holes or\nstellar-mass black holes in dense stellar clusters.

The first part of this paper gives an introduction to\nkinetic theory in non-curved spacetimes and then the Einstein-Vlasov system is\nintroduced.
