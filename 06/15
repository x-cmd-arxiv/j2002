Self-encounters of periodic orbits are\nreflected in certain patterns within symbol sequences, and these allow for\nanalytic treatment of the crossing statistics. In particular, the distributions\nof crossing angles and avoided-crossing widths thus come out as related by\nanalytic continuation. Moreover, the action difference for Sieber-Richter pairs\nof orbits (one orbit has a self-crossing which the other narrowly avoids and\notherwise the orbits look very nearly the same) results to all orders in the\ncrossing angle.

Using the assumption that regulatory sites can be\nrepresented as samples from weight matrices we derive a unique probability\ndistribution for assignments of sites into clusters. Our algorithm, 'PROCSE'\n(probabilistic clustering of sequences), uses Monte-Carlo sampling of this\ndistribution to partition and align thousands of short DNA sequences into\nclusters. The algorithm internally determines the number of clusters from the\ndata, and assigns significance to the resulting clusters.
