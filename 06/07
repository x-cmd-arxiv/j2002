Indeed, if $\\A$ is a nuclear $C^*$-algebra, then we\nhave $1\\le \\OL_\\infty (\\A) \\le 6$, and if $\\A$ is a unital nuclear\n$C^*$-algebra with $\\OL_{\\infty} (\\A) \\le (\\frac {1+{\\sqrt 5}}2)^{\\frac 12}$,\nwe show that $\\A$ must be stably finite.\n  We also investigate the connection between the rigid $\\OL_{\\infty, 1^+}$\nstructure and the rigid complete order $\\OL_{\\infty, 1^+}$ structure on\n$C^*$-algebras, where the latter structure has been studied by Blackadar and\nKirchberg in their characterization of strong NF $C^*$-algebras. Another main\nresult of this paper is to show that these two local structrues are actually\nequivalent on unital nuclear $C^*$-algebras. We obtain this by showing that if\na unital (nuclear) $C^*$-algebra is a rigid ${\\OL}_{\\infty, 1^+}$ space, then\nit is inner quasi-diagonal, and thus is a strong NF algebra. It is also shown\nthat if a unital (nuclear) $C^*$-algebra is an ${\\OL}_{\\infty, 1^+}$ space,\nthen it is quasi-diagonal, and thus is an NF algebra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jun 2002 22:45:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
