Utilizing\nspectrophotometric estimates of the absolute parallaxes of our astrometric\nreference stars and constraining delta Cep and reference star HD 213307 to\nbelong to the same association (Cep OB6, de Zeeuw et al. 1999), we find\npi_{abs} = 3.66 +/- 0.15 mas. The larger than typical astrometric residuals for\nthe nearby astrometric reference star HD 213307 are found to satisfy Keplerian\nmotion with P = 1.07 +/- 0.02 years, a perturbation and period that could be\ndue to a F0V companion ~7 mas distant from and ~4 magnitudes fainter than the\nprimary. Spectral classifications and VRIJHKT$_2$M and DDO51 photometry of the\nastrometric reference frame surrounding delta Cep indicate that field\nextinction is high and variable along this line of sight. However the\nextinction suffered by the reference star nearest (in angular separation and\ndistance) to delta Cep, HD 213307, is lower and nearly the same as for delta\nCep. Correcting for color differences, we find <A_V> = 0.23 +/- 0.03 for delta\nCep, hence, an absolute magnitude M_V = -3.47 +/- 0.10. Adopting an average V\nmagnitude, <V> = 15.03 +/- 0.03, for Cepheids with log P = 0.73 in the LMC from\nUdalski et al.
