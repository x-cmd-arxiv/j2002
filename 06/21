Evidence\nfor significant high-energy, postquiescent emission has been lacking.

Between the initial emission episode and the main peak, seen at both\nlow and high energy, there was a quiescent period of ~100 s during which the\nburst was relatively quiet. This burst was found as part of an ongoing search\nfor high-energy emission in gamma-ray bursts using the EGRET fixed interval (32\ns) accumulation spectra, which provide sensitivity to later, high-energy\nemission that is otherwise missed by the standard EGRET BATSE-triggered burst\nspectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jun 2002 18:56:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Jun 2002 23:02:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The theoretical\nand experimental consequences of the curvature-scalar mixing xi RHH introduced\non the visible brane are considered and simple sum rules that relate the\ncouplings of the mass eigenstates (h) and (phi) to pairs of vector bosons and\nfermions are derived. The sum rule for the ZZh and ZZ phi couplings in\ncombination with LEP/LEP2 data implies that not both the h and phi can be\nlight. We present explicit results for the still allowed region in the\n(mh,mphi) plane that remains after imposing the LEP upper limits for\nnon-standard scalar couplings to a ZZ pair. The phenomenological consequences\nof the mixing are investigated and, in particular, it is shown that the\nHiggs-boson decay h -> phi phi would provide an experimental signature for\nnon-zero xi and can have a very substantial impact on the Higgs-boson searches,\nhaving BR(h->phi phi) as large as 30 - 40 %.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jun 2002 22:57:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Such a stimulating situation essentially stems from two decisive\nadvancements. The first is the invention of reliable protocols for the\nmanipulation of single atoms. The second is the ability to produce desired\nbosonic environments on demand. These progresses have led to the possibility of\ncontrolling the form of the coupling between individual atoms and an arbitrary\nnumber of bosonic modes. As a consequence, fundamental matter-radiation\ninteraction models like, for instance, the JC model and most of its numerous\nnonlinear multiphoton generalizations, have been realized or simulated in\nlaboratory and their dynamical features have been tested more or less in\ndetail. This topical paper reviews the state of the art of the theoretical\ninvestigations and of the experimental observations concerning the dynamical\nfeatures of the coupling between single few-level atoms and two bosonic modes.\nIn the course of the paper we show that such a configuration provides an\nexcellent platform for investigating various quantum intermode correlation\neffects tested or testable in the cavity quantum electrodynamics and trapped\nion experimental realms. In particular we discuss a mode-mode correlation\neffect appearing in the dynamics of a two-level atom quadratically coupled to\ntwo bosonic modes. This effect, named parity effect, consists in a high\nsensitivity to the evenness or oddness of the total number of bosonic\nexcitations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jun 2002 14:52:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
