We model the IR emission with our\npopulation synthesis code, GRASIL (Silva et al. 1998). As for the radio\nemission, we revisit the simple model of Condon & Yin (1990). We find that a\ntightFIR/Radio correlation is natural when the synchrotron mechanism dominates\nover the inverse Compton, and the electrons cooling time is shorter than the\nfading time of the supernova rate. Observations indicate that both these\nconditions are met in star forming galaxies. However since the radio non\nthermal emission is delayed, deviations are expected both in the early phases\nof a starburst, when the radio thermal component dominates, and in the\npost-starburst phase, when the bulk of the NT component originates from less\nmassive stars. This delay allows the analysis of obscured starbursts with a\ntime resolution of a few tens of Myrs, unreachable with other star formation\nindicators. We suggest to complement the analysis of the deviations from the\nFIR/Radio correlation with the radio slope to obtain characteristic parameters\nof the burst. The analysis of a sample of compact ULIRGs shows that they are\nintense but transient starbursts, to which one should not apply usual SF\nindicators devised for constant SF rates. We also discuss the possibility of\nusing the q- radio slope diagram to asses the presence of obscured AGN. A firm\nprediction of the models is an apparent radio excess during the post-starburst\nphase, which seems to be typical of a class of star forming galaxies in rich\ncluster cores. We discuss how deviations from the correlation, due to the\nevolutionary status of the starburst, affect the technique of photometric\nredshift determination widely used for high-z sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jun 2002 16:02:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Turbulence is thus maintained for as long as the\naccumulation process lasts ($\\sim$ several Myr). Assuming that supersonic\nturbulence in MCs has the double role of preventing global collapse while\npromoting the formation of smaller-scale structures by turbulent compression\n(``turbulent fragmentation''), we then note the following properties: a)\nTurbulent fragmentation necessarily deposits progressively smaller fractions of\nthe total mass in regions of progressively smaller sizes, because the smaller\nstructures are subsets of the larger ones. b) The turbulent spectrum implies\nthat smaller scales have smaller velocity differences. Therefore, below some\nscale, denoted $l_{\\rm eq}$, the turbulent motions become subsonic. This is an\nenergy {\\it distribution} phenomenon, not a dissipative one. On this basis, we\npropose that the star formation efficiency (SFE) is determined by the fraction\nof the total mass that is deposited in clumps with masses larger than $M_{\\rm\nJ}(l_{\\rm eq})$, the Jeans mass at scale $l_{\\rm eq}$, because subsonic\nturbulence cannot promote any further subfragmentation. In this scenario, the\nSFE should be a monotonically increasing function of the sonic and turbulent\nequality scale, $l_{\\rm eq}$.

The fact that the\neffective quark propagators in these fermions have the same form as that in the\ncontinuum with the quark mass being only an additive parameter to a chirally\nsymmetric antihermitian Dirac operator is highlighted. This implies that there\nis no distinction between the heavy and light quarks and no mass dependent\ntuning of the action or operators as long as the discretization error $O(m^2\na^2)$ is negligible. Using the overlap fermion, we find that the $O(m^2a^2)$\n(and $O(ma^2)$) errors in the dispersion relations of the pseudoscalar and\nvector mesons and the renormalization of the axial-vector current and scalar\ndensity are small. This suggests that the applicable range of $ma$ may be\nextended to $\\sim 0.56$ with only 5% error, which is a factor of $\\sim 2.4$\nlarger than that of the improved Wilson action. We show that the generalized\nGell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation with unequal masses can be utilized to\ndetermine the finite $ma$ errors in the renormalization of the matrix elements\nfor the heavy-light decay constants and semileptonic decay constants of the B/D\nmeson.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jun 2002 13:56:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Jun 2002 14:34:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2004 20:14:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2005 19:28:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We study a space of functions\nimportant in many applications. A function space is weighted if certain\nvariables are more important than others; the weights show the relative\nimportance of the variables. In an unweighted space all variables are equally\nimportant and multivariate approximation is intractable. We want to study when\nthe complexity of multivariate approximation is independent of the number of\nvariables and depends polynomially on 1/E. The main conclusions are:\nMultivariate approximation on a quantum computer can be solved roughly\n(1/E)^(1+r) times faster than on a classical computer using randomization.\nHere, r is a positive parameter that depends on the weights and may be large.\nThis means that the speed-up of quantum over classical computers may be much\nlarger than quadratic. Multivariate approximation on a quantum computer is\nexponentially faster than on a classical computer with a worst case assurance\neven if the sum of weights is infinite but a certain power of them is finite.\nWe have designed a quantum algorithm with error at most E that uses about\nd+log(1/E) qubits. Hence, we have only linear dependence on the dimension d and\nlogarithmic dependence on 1/E. Therefore, for some applications the number of\nqubits is quite modest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jun 2002 13:29:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Jun 2002 00:25:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
