In the case of the\nstable lightest neutralino of the MSSM, and in particular the Constrained MSSM\n(CMSSM), the coannihilation with sleptons plays a major role in opening up\notherwise cosmologically excluded ranges of supersymmetric parameters. In this\npaper, we derive a full set of exact, analytic expressions for the\ncoannihilation of the lightest neutralino with the sleptons into all two--body\ntree--level final states in the framework of minimal supersymmetry. We make no\nsimplifying assumptions about the neutralino nor about sfermion masses and\nmixings other than the absence of explicit CP--violating terms and\ninter--family mixings. The expressions should be particularly useful in\ncomputing the neutralino WIMP relic abundance without the approximation of\npartial wave expansion. We illustrate the effect of our analytic results with\nnumerical examples and demonstrate a sizeable difference with approximate\nexpressions available in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jun 2002 09:21:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2002 11:56:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

In taking the limit we get a simple formula for\nthe entropy of a vortex field. We predict vorticity distributions of maximum\nentropy with given mean vorticity and enstrophy; also we predict the\ncylindrically symmetric vortex field with maximum entropy.

We show that, for\nconservative quantum systems, not only total energy, but also momentum is the\nconstant of motion. We derive the quantization conditions for two and more\nturning point problems. Exact energy eigenvalues for solvable and some\n``insoluble'' potentials are obtained.

This is the Hartman effect,\nwhich has been frequently associated with ``superluminality''. A fundamental\nlimitation on the effect is set by non-relativistic ``causality conditions''.\nWe demonstrate first that the causality conditions impose more restrictive\nbounds on the negative time delays (time advancements) when no bound states are\npresent. These restrictive bounds are in agreement with a naive, and generally\nfalse, causality argument based on the positivity of the ``extrapolated phase\ntime'', one of the quantities proposed to characterize the duration of the\nbarrier's traversal. Nevertheless, square wells may in fact lead to much larger\nadvancements than square barriers. We point out that close to thresholds of new\nbound states the time advancement increases considerably, while, at the same\ntime, the transmission probability is large, which facilitates the possible\nobservation of the enhanced time advancement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jun 2002 15:06:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}
