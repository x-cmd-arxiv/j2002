In this paper we investigate whether the knowledge of\nmany metabolic pathways and their catalyzing enzymes accumulated over the years\ncan help improve the performance of classifiers for this problem.\n  The complex network of known biochemical reactions in the cell results in a\nrepresentation where genes are nodes of a graph. Formulating the problem as a\ngraph-driven features extraction problem, based on the simple idea that\nrelevant features are likely to exhibit correlation with respect to the\ntopology of the graph, we end up with an algorithm which involves encoding the\nnetwork and the set of expression profiles into kernel functions, and\nperforming a regularized form of canonical correlation analysis in the\ncorresponding reproducible kernel Hilbert spaces.\n  Function prediction experiments for the genes of the yeast S. Cerevisiae\nvalidate this approach by showing a consistent increase in performance when a\nstate-of-the-art classifier uses the vector of features instead of the original\nexpression profile to predict the functional class of a gene.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2002 08:18:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The\nresults of such an experiment contain several hundred thousand numbers, that\ncome in the form of a table, of several thousand rows (one for each gene) and\n50 - 100 columns (one for each sample). We developed a clustering methodology\nto mine such data. In this review I provide a very basic introduction to the\nsubject, aimed at a physics audience with no prior knowledge of either gene\nexpression or clustering methods. I explain what genes are, what is gene\nexpression and how it is measured by DNA chips. Next I explain what is meant by\n\"clustering\" and how we analyze the massive amounts of data from such\nexperiments, and present results obtained from analysis of data obtained from\ncolon cancer, brain tumors and breast cancer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2002 08:27:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Here it has been shown that the quantum search problem could be\nsolved in polynomial time on an NMR quantum computer. The NMR ensemble quantum\ncomputation is based on the quantum mechanical unitary dynamics that both a\nclosed quantum system and its ensemble obey the same quantum mechanical unitary\ndynamics instead of on the pseudopure state or the effective pure state of the\nclassical NMR quantum computation. Based on the new principle the conventional\nNMR multiple-quantum spectroscopy has been developed to solve experimentally\nthe search problem. The solution information of the search problem is first\nloaded on the unitary evolution propagator which is constructed with the oracle\nunitary operation and oracle-independent unitary operations and is used to\nexcite the multiple-quantum coherence in a spin ensemble. Then the multiple-\nquantum spectroscopy is used to extract experimentally the solution\ninformation. It has been discussed how to enhance the output NMR signal of the\nquantum search NMR multiple-quantum pulse sequence and some approaches to\nenhancing the NMR signal are also proposed.
