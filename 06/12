The hot white dwarf ionizes the low-density bipolar outflow\ncavities inside the dense torus, producing a small HII region observed at radio\nwavelengths. We propose an evolutionary scenario for the formation of the Red\nRectangle nebula, in which the binary initially had 2.3 and 1.9 Msun components\nat a separation of 130 Rsun.
