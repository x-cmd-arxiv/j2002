We show that\nIBS calculations for the ATF damping ring, when using the formalism of\nBjorken-Mtingwa, a modified formalism of Piwinski (where eta squared divided by\nbeta has been replaced by the dispersion invariant), or a simple high-energy\napproximate formula all give results that agree well. Comparing theory,\nincluding the effect of potential well bunch lengthening, with a complete set\nof ATF steady-state beam size vs. current measurements we find reasonably good\nagreement for energy spread and horizontal emittance. The measured vertical\nemittance, however, is larger than theory in both offset (zero current\nemittance) and slope (emittance change with current). The slope error indicates\nmeasurement error and/or additional current-dependent physics at the ATF; the\noffset error, that the assumed Coulomb log is correct to within a factor of\n1.75.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Jun 2002 18:30:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
