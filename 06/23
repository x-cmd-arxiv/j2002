Within an isospin-dependent hadronic transport model using\nphenomenological equations of state ({\\rm EOS}) for dense neutron-rich matter,\nit is shown that the isospin asymmetry of the HD nuclear matter formed in high\nenergy heavy-ion collisions is determined mainly by the HD behaviour of nuclear\nsymmetry energy. Experimental signatures in several sensitive probes, i.e.,\n$\\pi^-$ to $\\pi^+$ ratio, transverse collective flow and its excitation\nfunction as well as neutron-proton differential flow, are investigated. A\nprecursor of the possible isospin separation instability in dense neutron-rich\nmatter is predicted to appear as the local minima in the excitation functions\nof the transverse flow parameter for both neutrons and protons above the pion\nproduction threshold. Because of its {\\it qualitative} nature unlike other {\\it\nquantitative} observables, this precursor can be used as a unique signature of\nthe isospin dependence of the nuclear {\\rm EOS}. Measurements of these\nobservables will provide the first terrestrial data to constrain stringently\nthe HD behaviour of nuclear symmetry energy and thus also the {\\rm EOS} of\ndense neutron-rich matter. Implications of our findings to neutron star studies\nare also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Jun 2002 21:58:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
