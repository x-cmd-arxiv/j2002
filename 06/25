With this in mind, we discuss the mechanisms that\nbroaden solid state absorption bands. It is shown that ellipsoidally shaped\npure CO grains fit the bands of both isotopes at the same time. Reasonable fits\nare also obtained by CO embedded in N2-rich ices and thermally processed\nO2-rich ices.

The narrow absorption by apolar CO ices is present in\nboth spectra, but much stronger in NGC 7538.

In fact, the blast wave is dramatically\ninfluenced by the leading gamma-ray front which preaccelerates the ambient\nmedium and loads it with electron-positron pairs. The front sweeps the medium\noutward with a high Lorentz factor and results in a spectacular effect: the GRB\nejecta moves freely in a cavity behind its own radiation front. When the front\nexpands sufficiently and gets diluted, a blast wave develops, and it does it\ndifferently from the standard model used before. The afterglow should initially\nappear as a steep rise of soft emission (from infrared to soft X-rays) at a\ntime comparable to the prompt GRB duration and then the emission should quickly\nevolve to a normal X-ray afterglow. This may explain the prompt optical flash\nobserved in GRB 990123 and allows one to infer the ejecta Lorentz factor in\nthis burst: \\Gamma=200. The effect of the gamma-ray front on the afterglow\nemission is especially pronounced if the GRB has a massive progenitor and the\nblast wave propagates in the progenitor wind.

Observations were obtained simultaneously with\nboth large X-ray observatories, XMM-Newton and Chandra. We compare the\nhigh-resolution spectra acquired with the Reflection Grating Spectrometer\nonboard XMM-Newton and with the Low Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer\nonboard Chandra, and evidence in direct comparison the good performance of both\ninstruments in terms of wavelength and flux calibration. The strongest lines in\nthe X-ray spectrum of YY Gem are from oxygen. Oxygen line ratios indicate the\npresence of a low-temperature component (1-4 MK) with density n_e < 2 10^{10}\ncm^-3. The X-ray lightcurve reveals two flares and a dip corresponding to the\nsecondary eclipse. An increase of the density during phases of high activity is\nsuggested from time-resolved spectroscopy. Time-resolved global fitting of the\nEuropean Photon Imaging Camera CCD spectrum traces the evolution of temperature\nand emission measure during the flares. These medium-resolution spectra show\nthat temperatures > 10^7 K are relevant in the corona of YY Gem although not as\ndominant as the lower temperatures represented by the strongest lines in the\nhigh-resolution spectrum. Magnetic loops with length on the order of 10^9 cm,\ni.e., about 5 % of the radius of each star, are inferred from a comparison with\na one-dimensional hydrodynamic model. This suggests that the flares did not\nerupt in the (presumably more extended) inter-binary magnetosphere but are\nrelated to one of the components of the binary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jun 2002 07:47:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Here $T_0$ would be\ninterpreted as the phase transition temperature. For finite systems such as\nthose obtained in nuclear collisions, this parametrisation is only approximate\nand hence allows for extraction of $T_0$ in more than one way. In this work we\nlook in detail at how values of $T_0$ differ, depending on methods of\nextraction. It should be mentioned that for finite systems, this approximate\nparametrisation works not only at the critical point, but also for first order\nphase transitions (at least in some models). Thus the approximate fit is no\nguarantee that one is seeing a critical phenomenon. A different but more\nconventional search for the nuclear phase transition would look for a maximum\nin the specific heat as a function of temperature $T_2$. In this case $T_2$ is\ninterpreted as the phase transition temperature. Ideally $T_0$ and $T_2$ would\ncoincide. We invesigate this possibility, both in theory and from the ISiS\ndata, performing both canonical ($T$) and microcanonical ($e=E^*/A$)\ncalculations. Although more than one value of $T_0$ can be extracted from the\napproximate parmetrisation, the work here points to the best value from among\nthe choices.
