These calculations are here extended to the nonaxisymmetric case under\nthin-disk approximation, which allows for a detailed investigation into the\nprocess of fragmentation, fundamental to binary, multiple system, and cluster\nformation. We have shown previously that initially axisymmetric, magnetically\nsubcritical clouds with an $m=2$ density perturbation of modest fractional\namplitude ($\\sim 5%$) can develop highly elongated bars, which facilitate\nbinary and multiple system formation.

These\nmultiple cores are magnetically supercritical. They are expected to collapse\ninto single stars or stellar systems individually and, collectively, to form a\nsmall stellar group. Our calculations demonstrate that the standard scenario\nfor single star formation involving magnetically subcritical clouds and\nambipolar diffusion can readily produce more than one star, provided that the\ncloud mass is well above the Jeans limit and relatively uniformly distributed.\nThe fragments develop in the central part of the cloud, after the region has\nbecome magnetically supercritical but before rapid collapse sets in.

Here, we try to clarify this behaviour and show that\nit is due to the different physical approach taken by each approximation: On\nthe one hand, the subseismic approximation considers the low frequency part of\nthe spectrum of (say) gravity modes and turns out to be valid only in the\ncentral region of a star; on the other hand, the anelastic approximation\nconsiders the Brunt-Vaisala frequency as asymptotically small and makes no\nassumption on the order of the modes.

This value is high compared both\nto the observed entropy floor of ~100 keV cm^2 and to the expected value from\ngravitational heating.

The aim was to\ndescribe the motion of a relativistic binary pulsar that is perturbed by a\nthird mass and look for resonances between the binary and third mass orbits.\nNumerical integration of an equation of relative motion that approximates the\nbinary gives evidence of such resonances. These $(m:n)$ resonances are defined\nfor the present purposes by the resonance condition, $m\\omega=2n\\Omega$, where\n$m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers and $\\omega$ and $\\Omega$ are the\nangular frequencies of the binary orbit and third mass orbit, respectively. The\nresonance condition consequently fixes a value for the semimajor axis $a$ of\nthe binary orbit for the duration of the resonance because of the Kepler\nrelationship $\\omega=a^{-3/2}$. This paper outlines a method of averaging\ndeveloped by Chicone, Mashhoon, and Retzloff which renders a nonlinear system\nthat undergoes resonance capture into a mathematically amenable form. This\nmethod is applied to the present system and one arrives at an analytical\nsolution that describes the average motion during resonance. Furthermore,\nprominent features of the full nonlinear system, such as the frequency of\noscillation and antidamping, accord with their analytically derived formulae.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jun 2002 05:42:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2002 05:58:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

As a consistency test, application has been made to form wave\nfunctions for 40Ca and they have been used also to specify relevant proton-40Ca\noptical potentials with which elastic scattering has been predicted.

Two examples of mechanical devices are introduced here that\nrepresent ``Physical Chirality''. These are a rotating water sprinkler and a\nvariant of Crookes' radiometer. When interacting with appropriate media, they\nboth choose only one mode of rotation out of two possible ones. Such a behavior\ndoes not obey time-reversal invariance, which is regarded to be a rule in\nclassical mechanics. This is due to their chiral nature. Instead, they do obey\na space-time (ST) law of invariance, that is, what is rotating in the opposite\ndirection is the mirror-image of the given device. In a recent experiment of\nKoumura et al. they discovered a similar behavior of a molecular rotor. The\npossible biological significance of physical chirality is emphasized hereby,\nand the conclusion is that chiral molecular systems do not reach readily\nthermal equilibrium. In other words: ``Physical chirality does feed on negative\nentropy'', and therefore, it may well be of crucial value to life.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jun 2002 07:24:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 23 Jun 2002 08:14:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

To avoid such an action at a distance, EPR\nconcluded that Quantum Mechanics had to be incomplete. However, its extensions\ninvolving additional \"hidden variables\", allowing for the recovery of\ndeterminism and locality, have been disproved experimentally (Bell's theorem).\nHere, I present an opposite solution of the paradox based on the greater\nindeterminism of the modern Quantum Field Theory (QFT) description of Particle\nPhysics, that prevents the preparation of any state having a definite number of\nparticles. The resulting uncertainty in photons radiation has interesting\nconsequences in Quantum Information Theory (e.g. cryptography and\nteleportation). Moreover, since it allows for less elements of EPR physical\nreality than the old non-relativistic Quantum Mechanics, QFT satisfies the EPR\ncondition of completeness without the need of hidden variables. The residual\nphysical reality does never violate locality, thus the unique objective proof\nof \"quantum nonlocality\" is removed in an interpretation-independent way. On\nthe other hand, the supposed nonlocality of the EPR correlations turns out to\nbe a problem of the interpretation of the theory. If we do not rely on hidden\nvariables or new physics beyond QFT, the unique viable interpretation is a\nminimal statistical one, that preserves locality and Lorentz symmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jun 2002 13:47:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Mar 2004 17:15:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
