The bootstrap method allows us to estimate the\nstatistical significance of the null hypothesis H0 of an absence of crossover\n(c0=infinity). When H0 is rejected, we estimate the crossover c0 using two\ndifferent competing models for the second regime beyond c0 and the bootstrap\nmethod. For the catalog obtained by aggregating 14 subduction zones of the\nCircum Pacific Seismic Belt, our estimate of the crossover point is log(c0)\n=28.14 +- 0.40 (c0 in dyne-cm), corresponding to a crossover magnitude mW=8.1\n+- 0.3. For separate subduction zones, the corresponding estimates are much\nmore uncertain, so that the null hypothesis of an identical crossover for all\nsubduction zones cannot be rejected. Such a large value of the crossover\nmagnitude makes it difficult to associate it directly with a seismogenic\nthickness as proposed by many different authors in the past. Our measure of c0\nmay substantiate the concept that the localization of strong shear deformation\ncould propagate significantly in the lower crust and upper mantle, thus\nincreasing the effective size beyond which one should expect a change of\nregime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2002 05:27:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

First, we show that the option valuation is not\nuniquely determined; in particular, stratergies based on the delta-hedge and\nCAMP (Capital Asset Pricing Model) are shown to provide different valuations of\nan option. Second, asset returns are known not to be Gaussian distributed.\nEmpirically, distributions of returns are seen to be much better approximated\nby an exponential distribution.

We show how the\nFokker-Planck formulation of fluctuations (i.e., the dynamics of the\ndistribution) can be modified to provide an exponential distribution for\nreturns.

Based on an analogy with single top production and polarized top\nquark decay, we reproduce in a simple way the results by G.Mahlon and S.Parke\non the existence of preferred axes for the decomposition of the top quark spin.\nFor the W*- and W-g fusion production modes these axes are related to the\ndown-type quark momentum. The proposed method allows finding kinematical\nconditions for the observation of top quark polarization in a third process\nthat contributes to single top production and is important at LHC energies, the\ntW-process, in which spin effects are smeared out by the contribution of\ndiagrams with a QCD gtt-vertex. A simple Monte-Carlo analysis of spin\ncorrelations for the tW-process with subsequent top decay is given as an\nillustration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jan 2002 16:37:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We explicitly identify the occurrence of\nincreasing multi-partite entanglement in Shor's algorithm. Our results do not\napply to quantum algorithms operating on mixed states in general and we discuss\nthe suggestion that an exponential computational speed-up might be possible\nwith mixed states in the total absence of entanglement. Finally, despite the\nessential role of entanglement for pure state algorithms, we argue that it is\nnevertheless misleading to view entanglement as a key resource for quantum\ncomputational power.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2002 15:08:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Mar 2002 14:09:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
