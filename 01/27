The flows are generally referred to as ``convection-dominated,'' and\nare characterized by inward transport of angular momentum by thermal convection\nand outward viscous transport, vanishing mass accretion, and vanishing local\nenergy dissipation. We examine the viability of these ideas by explicitly\ncalculating the leading order angular momentum transport of axisymmetric modes\nin magnetized, differentially rotating, stratified flows. The modes are\ndestabilized by the generalized magnetorotational instability. There are no\ninward transporting modes at all unless the magnitude of the (imaginary) Brunt\nfrequency is comparable to the epicyclic frequency, a condition requiring\nsubstantial levels of dissipation. When inward transporting modes do exist,\nthey appear at long wavelengths, unencumbered by magnetic tension. Moreover,\nvery general thermodynamic principles prohibit the complete recovery of\nirreversible dissipative energy losses, a central feature of\nconvection-dominated models. Dissipation of the free energy of differential\nrotation inevitably requires outward angular momentum transport. Our results\nare in good agreement with global MHD simulations, which find significant\nlevels of outward transport and energy dissipation, whether or not\ndestabilizing entropy gradients are present.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Jan 2002 16:06:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2002 21:15:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

One of the reasons to discuss this matter derives from the\ndesire of being allowed to deal with physical stochastic fields, such as the\ngravitational one, which cannot give rise to white noises. From our point of\nview the most relevant motivation for the approach we propose here derives from\nthe fact that in relativistic models the occurrence of white noises is the main\nresponsible for the appearance of untractable divergences. Therefore, one can\nhope that resorting to non white noises one can overcome such a difficulty. We\ninvestigate stochastic equations with non white noises, we discuss their\nreduction properties and their physical implications.
