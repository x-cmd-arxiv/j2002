Conversion of a part of the gas into\nhigh-mass stars or stellar-mass black holes, and the release of energy in these\nobjects by fusion or accretion, may help to stabilize the remaining gas. If the\ndisk extends beyond a parsec, however, more energy is probably required for\nstability than is available by turning half the gas into high-mass stars.

However,\npredictions of neutron radii, which are not tightly constrained by reliable\ndata, vary significantly. The nature of this variation is investigated using\ncorrelations between basic properties of the models and the neutron skin\nthickness in lead. The results suggest that conventional covariant models are\ntoo limited. The study is guided by principles and insights of effective field\ntheory (EFT), such as power counting, and the relation of mean-field models to\na more general EFT approach to nuclei is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Dec 2001 18:48:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2002 15:44:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2002 16:32:22 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2002 15:08:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-09"}

In this circuit, the advance time more\nthan twenty percent of the pulse width can easily be achieved.
