Here, we report on results from a large-scale imaging survey of\nthe Galactic center with sufficient spatial resolution to allow a clean\nseparation of the two components. The highly-ionized Fe emission, previously\nattributed to the diffuse emission, is found largely due to the discrete X-ray\nsource population.

They\ndiscuss groups of symplectomorphisms of closed symplectic manifolds (M,\\om)\nfrom various points of view. Lectures 1 and 2 provide an overview of our\ncurrent knowledge of their algebraic, geometric and homotopy theoretic\nproperties. Lecture 3 sketches the arguments used by Gromov, Abreu and\nAbreu-McDuff to figure out the rational homotopy type of these groups in the\ncases M= CP^2 and M=S^2\\times S^2. We outline the needed J-holomorphic curve\ntechniques. Much of the recent progress in understanding the geometry and\ntopology of these groups has come from studying the properties of fibrations\nwith the manifold M as fiber and structural group equal either to the\nsymplectic group or to its Hamiltonian subgroup Ham(M). The case when the base\nis S^2 has proved particularly important. Lecture 4 describes the geometry of\nHamiltonian fibrations over S^2, while Lecture 5 discusses their Gromov-Witten\ninvariants via the Seidel representation. It ends by sketching Entov's\nexplanation of the ABW inequalities for eigenvalues of products of special\nunitary matrices. Finally in Lecture 6 we apply the ideas developed in the\nprevious two lectures to demonstrate the existence of (short) paths in\nHam(M,\\om) that minimize the Hofer norm over all paths with the given\nendpoints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Jan 2002 13:19:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2004 16:14:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
