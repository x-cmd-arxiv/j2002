A more fundamental theory (of which Einstein's\ntheory is a symmetry broken phase) is then expected to take account of further\ndescription of the collapse. I propose a simple (classical) model for the\ndescription of the late stages of the gravitational collapse: A non-Riemannian,\nscale-invariant version of 5-dimensional Kaluza-Klein theory in which the\nstandard Riemann structure of the higher-dimensional manifold is replaced by a\nWeyl-integrable one.

The perfect mirrors we study are of the type\nthat rely on light internal degrees of freedom which adjust to and reflect\nimpinging radiation. We suggest that a minimum of one internal mirror degree of\nfreedom is required for each bulk field degree of freedom reflected. A short\ncalculation then shows that such mirrors necessarily absorb enough heat from\nthe thermal bath that their increased mass prevents them from floating on the\nthermal radiation. For this type of mirror the paradox is therefore resolved.\nWe also observe that this failure of boxes to ``float'' invalidates one of the\nassumptions going into the Unruh-Wald analysis of entropy balances involving\nboxes lowered adiabatically toward black holes.

In this paper, we take the\nToeplitz and Virasoro approach for a fairly large class of symbols, leading to\na systematic and simple way of generating such recursion relations.\n  The latter are very naturally expressed in terms of the $L$-matrices\nappearing in the Lax pair for the Toeplitz lattice equations.

The current research in the\nliterature has focussed on using a polynomial number of qubits. A new\nmathematical model of computation called \\emph{Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs)}\nis defined, building on Deutsch's model of quantum computational network. The\nmodel introduces a nonlinear and irreversible gate, similar to the speculative\noperator defined by Abrams and Lloyd. The precise dynamics of this operator are\ndefined and while giving examples in which nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger's\nequations are applied, we speculate on its possible implementation. The many\npractical problems associated with the current model of quantum computing are\nalleviated in the new model. It is shown that QNNs of logarithmic size and\nconstant depth have the same computational power as threshold circuits, which\nare used for modeling neural networks. QNNs of polylogarithmic size and\npolylogarithmic depth can solve the problems in \\NC, the class of problems with\ntheoretically fast parallel solutions.

The first is Markovian feedback as\nintroduced in quantum optics by Wiseman and Milburn [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 70},\n548 (1993)]. The second is feedback based on an estimate of the system state,\ndeveloped recently by Doherty {\\em et al.} [Phys. Rev. A {\\bf 62}, 012105\n(2000)]. Here we choose to call it, for brevity, {\\em Bayesian feedback}. For\nsystems with nonlinear dynamics, we expect these two methods of feedback\ncontrol to give markedly different results. The simplest possible nonlinear\nsystem is a driven and damped two-level atom, so we choose this as our model\nsystem. The monitoring is taken to be homodyne detection of the atomic\nfluorescence, and the control is by modulating the driving. The aim of the\nfeedback in both cases is to stabilize the internal state of the atom as close\nas possible to an arbitrarily chosen pure state, in the presence of inefficient\ndetection and other forms of decoherence. Our results (obtain without recourse\nto stochastic simulations) prove that Bayesian feedback is never inferior, and\nis usually superior, to Markovian feedback. However it would be far more\ndifficult to implement than Markovian feedback and it loses its superiority\nwhen obvious simplifying approximations are made. It is thus not clear which\nform of feedback would be better in the face of inevitable experimental\nimperfections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jan 2002 00:16:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
