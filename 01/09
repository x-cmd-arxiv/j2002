In these examples each bit is treated symmetrically so the cost\nfunction depends only on the Hamming weight of the n bits. We also give two\nexamples, closely related to these, where the similarity breaks down in that\nthe quantum adiabatic algorithm succeeds in polynomial time whereas simulated\nannealing requires exponential time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jan 2002 20:26:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In this paper we generalize the usual model. We consider a model of\nquantum computations in which the state is an operator of density matrix and\nthe gates are quantum operations, not necessarily unitary. A mixed state\n(operator of density matrix) of n two-level quantum systems is considered as an\nelement of $4^{n}$-dimensional operator Hilbert space. Unitary quantum gates\nand nonunitary quantum operations for n-qubit system are considered as\ngeneralized quantum gates acting on mixed state.
