The quasar\nwas detected with a 1.2mm flux density of 0.87 +-0.20 mJy. The lack of\ndetectable 1.4 GHz radio emission indicates that the millimeter emission is of\nthermal nature, making RD0301 the most distant dust-emission source known. When\nmatching a 50K grey body thermal far-infrared (FIR) spectrum to the observed\nmillimeter flux we imply a FIR luminosity ~4x10^12 L_sun, which is comparable\nto the quasar's optical luminosity. If the FIR luminosity arises from massive\nstar formation, the implied star formation rate would be ~600 M_sun/yr,\ncomparable to that of the starburst galaxies which dominate the average star\nformation and FIR emission in the early Universe. The FIR luminosity of RD0301\nis close to the average of that found in optically far more luminous\nhigh-redshift quasars. The comparably high millimeter to optical brightness\nratio of RD0301 is further evidence for that there is no strong correlation\nbetween the optical and millimeter brightness of high-redshift quasars,\nsupporting the idea that in high-redshift quasars the dust is not heated by the\nAGN, but by starbursts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Jan 2002 20:10:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The\nbuildup of J is modeled via dynamical friction and tidal stripping in mergers.\nThis reveals how over-cooling in incoming halos leads to transfer of J from\nbaryons to dark matter (DM), in conflict with observations. By incorporating a\nsimple recipe of supernova feedback, we match the observed J distribution in\ndisks. Gas removal from small incoming halos, which make the low-J component of\nthe product, eliminates the low-J baryons. Partial heating and puffing-up of\nthe gas in larger incoming halos, combined with tidal stripping, reduces the J\nloss of baryons. This implies a higher baryonic spin for lower mass halos. The\nobserved low baryonic fraction in dwarf galaxies is used to calibrate the\ncharacteristic velocity associated with supernova feedback, yielding v_fb sim\n100 km/s, within the range of theoretical expectations. The model then\nreproduces the observed distribution of spin parameter among dwarf and bright\ngalaxies, as well as the J distribution inside these galaxies.

We show that the coupling of the\ndark energy scalar field, or Quintessence, to the Ricci scalar induces a\n\"dragging\" of its density perturbations through the general relativistic\ngravitational potentials. We discuss, in particular, how this process forces\ndark energy to behave as a pressureless component if the cosmic evolution is\ndominated by non-relativistic matter. This property is also analyzed in terms\nof the effective sound speed of the dark energy, which correspondingly\napproaches the behavior of the dominant cosmological component, being\neffectively vanishing after matter-radiation equality. To illustrate this\neffect, we consider Extended Quintessence scenarios involving a quadratic\ncoupling between the field and the Ricci scalar. We show that Quintessence\ndensity perturbations reach non-linearity at scales and redshifts relevant for\nthe structure formation process, respecting all the existing constraints on\nscalar-tensor theories of Gravity. This study opens new perspectives on the\nstandard picture of structure formation in dark energy cosmologies, since the\nQuintessence field itself, if non-minimally coupled to Gravity, may undergo\nclustering processes, eventually forming density perturbations exiting from the\nlinear regime. A non-linear approach is then required to further investigate\nthe evolution of these structures, and in particular their role in the dark\nhaloes surrounding galaxies and clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Jan 2002 12:33:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Apr 2002 22:19:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Associated with these\ntwo energy scales are two special quantum-mechanical (QM) regimes in the theory\nof driven system. These are the QM adiabatic regime, and the QM\nnon-perturbative regime respectively. Otherwise Fermi golden rule applies, and\nlinear response theory can be trusted.
