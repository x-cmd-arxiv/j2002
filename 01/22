Contrary to previous claims, we demonstrate that this is\npossible, if the dynamical coupling between the escaping CRs and thermal plasma\nis taken into account, and thus a self-consistent GALACTIC WIND calculation is\ncarried out. Given a dependence of the CR source distribution on Galactocentric\nradius, r, our numerical wind solutions show that the CR outflow velocity,\nV(r,z) depends both on r, and on vertical distance, z, at reference level z_C.\nThe latter is defined as the transition boundary from diffusion to advection\ndominated CR transport and is therefore also a function of r. In fact, the CR\nescape time averaged over particle energies decreases with increasing CR source\nstrength. Such an increase is counteracted by a reduced average CR residence\ntime in the gas disk. Therfore pronounced peaks in the radial source\ndistribution result in mild radial gamma-ray gradients at GeV energies, as it\nhas been observed. This effect is enhanced by anisotropic diffusion, assuming\ndifferent radial and vertical diffusion coefficients.

Central to the\nmodel is the assumption that the penetrating ac magnetic field modifies the\nvortex lattice mobility, trapping different robust dynamical states in\ndifferent regions of the sample. We discuss in detail on the response of the\nsuperconductor to an ac magnetic field when the vortex lattice mobility is not\nuniform inside the sample. We begin with an analytical description for a simple\ngeometry (slab) and then we perform numerical calculations for a strip in a\ntransverse magnetic field which include relaxation effects. In calculations,\nthe vortex system is assumed to coexist in different pinning regimes. The\nvortex behavior in the regions where the induced current density j has been\nalways below a given threshold (j_c^>) is described by an elastic Campbell-like\nregime (or a critical state regime with local high critical current density,\nj_c^>). When the VS is shaken by symmetrical (e.g. sinusoidal) ac fields, the\ncritical current density is modified to j_c^< (which is smaller than j_c^>) at\nregions where vortices have been forced to oscillate by a current density\nlarger than j_c^>. Experimentally, an initial state with high critical current\ndensity (j_c^>) can be obtained by zero field cooling, field cooling (with no\napplied ac field) or by shaking the vortex lattice with an asymmetrical (e.g.\nsawtooth) field.

We consider in particular the question, what\nis the probability that the system's trajectory passes through a set of regions\nof configuration space without reference to time? We first consider the\nclassical case, where the answer has a variety of forms in terms of a phase\nspace probability distribution function.

Naive calculations of the\nelectromagnetic energy and the work performed by the electromagnetic fields\nmight lead to paradoxes of apparent non-conservation of energy. A few paradoxes\nof this type for a simple motion of two charges are presented and resolved in a\nquantitative way providing deeper insight into various relativistic effects in\nthe classical electromagnetic theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2002 12:50:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The main\ncharacteristic of such a theory is discussed: the theory must be valid and and\nsufficiently strong, and it must maximally describe its own validity and\nsufficient strength. The mathematical logical definition of validity is used,\nand sufficient strength is seen to be a necessary and useful concept. The\nrequirement of maximal description of its own validity and sufficient strength\nmay be useful to reject candidate coherent theories for which the description\nis less than maximal. Other aspects of a coherent theory discussed include\nuniversal applicability, the relation to the anthropic principle, and possible\nuniqueness. It is suggested that the basic properties of the physical and\nmathematical universes are entwined with and emerge with a coherent theory.\nSupport for this includes the indirect reality status of properties of very\nsmall or very large far away systems compared to moderate sized nearby systems.\nDiscussion of the necessary physical nature of language includes physical\nmodels of language and a proof that the meaning content of expressions of any\naxiomatizable theory seems to be independent of the algorithmic complexity of\nthe theory.

The strategy chosen is to begin by\nfocusing on the class of abelian quantum hidden subgroup algorithms, i.e., the\nclass of abelian algorithms of the Shor/Simon genre. Our strategy is to make\nthis class of algorithms as mathematically transparent as possible. By the\nphrase \"mathematically transparent\" we mean to expose, to bring to the surface,\nand to make explicit the concealed mathematical structures that are inherently\nand fundamentally a part of such algorithms. In so doing, we create symbolic\nabelian quantum hidden subgroup algorithms that are analogous to the those\nsymbolic algorithms found within such software packages as Axiom, Cayley,\nMaple, Mathematica, and Magma.\n  As a spin-off of this effort, we create three different generalizations of\nShor's quantum factoring algorithm to free abelian groups of finite rank. We\nrefer to these algorithms as wandering (or vintage Z_Q) Shor algorithms. They\nare essentially quantum algorithms on free abelian groups A of finite rank n\nwhich, with each iteration, first select a random cyclic direct summand Z of\nthe group A and then apply one iteration of the standard Shor algorithm to\nproduce a random character of the \"approximating\" finite group A=Z_Q, called\nthe group probe. These characters are then in turn used to find either the\norder P of a maximal cyclic subgroup Z_P of the hidden quotient group H_phi, or\nthe entire hidden quotient group H_phi. An integral part of these wandering\nquantum algorithms is the selection of a very special random transversal, which\nwe refer to as a Shor transversal. The algorithmic time complexity of the first\nof these wandering Shor algorithms is found to be O(n^2(lgQ)^3(lglgQ)^(n+1)).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2002 06:20:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 Feb 2002 05:39:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2002 19:24:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-27"}
