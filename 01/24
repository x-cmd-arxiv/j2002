These data -- which cover the nuclear regions of the target\ngalaxies -- allow us to quantify for the first time the various components that\ncontribute to the UV excess in the population of powerful, intermediate\nredshift radio galaxies. We find that, contrary to the results of previous\nsurveys -- which have tended to be biased towards the most luminous and\nspectacular objects in any redshift range -- the contribution of scattered\nquasar light to the UV excess is relatively minor in most of the objects in our\nsample. Only 7 objects (32% of the complete sample) show significant\npolarization in the rest-frame UV, and none of the objects in our sample is\npolarized in the near-UV at the P > 10% level. Careful measurement and\nmodelling of our spectra have allowed us to quantify the contributions of other\ncomponents to the UV excess. We show that nebular continuum (present in all\nobjects at the 3 -- 40% level), direct AGN light (significant in 40% of\nobjects), and young stellar populations (significant in 15 -- 50% of objects)\nall make important contributions to the UV continuum in the population of\npowerful radio galaxies. These results serve to emphasise the multi-component\nnature of the UV continuum in radio galaxies. The results also point to an\ninteresting link betweeen the optical/UV and far-IR properties of our sample\nobjects, in the sense that the objects with the clearest evidence for\noptical/UV starburst activity are also the most luminous at far-IR wavelengths.\nThis supports the idea that the cooler dust components in radio galaxies are\nheated by starbursts rather than by AGN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2002 17:01:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The time\nevolution can be described numerically by a stochastic process such as the\nMetropolis algorithm. The number of pure, equivalent, ground states is q for\nthe Potts model and r for the hard particle model, and it is known that for r\nor q larger or equal to d+1, the final equilibrium state may be\npolycrystalline, i.e. not made of a uniform phase.

Optical microscopy\nand surface quasi--elastic light scattering have been used to characterize\naggregation of CaCO$_3$ particles at the air--water interface. The structures\nformed by cluster-cluster aggregation are two dimensional fractals which grow\nto eventually form a percolating network. This process is measured through\nimage analysis. On the same system we measure the dynamics of interfacial\nthermal fluctuations (surface ripplons), and we discuss how the relaxation\nprocess is affected by the growing clusters. We show that the structures start\ndamping the ripplons strongly when the two length scales are comparable. No\nmacroscopic surface pressure is measured and this is in contrast to lipid,\nsurfactant or polymer monolayers at concentrations corresponding to surface\ncoverage. This observation and the difficulty in fitting the ripplon spectrum\nwith traditional models suggest that a different physical mechanism might be\nresponsible for the observed damping of ripplons in this system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2002 13:03:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The influence of\nmomentum-dependent potentials for the nucleon, hyperon and kaon in the final\nstate are studied as well as the importance of $K^+$ elastic rescattering in\nthe target nucleus. The transport calculations are compared to the experimental\n$K^+$ spectra taken at LBL Berkeley, SATURNE, CELSIUS, GSI and COSY-J\\\"ulich.\nIt is found that the momentum-dependent baryon potentials effect the excitation\nfunction of the $K^+$ cross section; at low bombarding energies of $\\sim $ 1.0\nGeV the attractive baryon potentials in the final state lead to a relative\nenhancement of the kaon yield whereas the net repulsive potential at bombarding\nenergies $\\sim$ 2 GeV causes a decrease of the $K^+$ cross section. Furthermore\nit is pointed out, that especially the $K^+$ spectra at low momenta (or kinetic\nenergy $T_K$) allow to determine the in-medium $K^+$ potential almost model\nindependently due to a relative shift of the $K^+$ spectra in kinetic energy\nthat arises from the acceleration of the kaons when propagating out of the\nnuclear medium to free space, i.e. converting potential energy to kinetic\nenergy of the free kaon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2002 15:27:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-20"}

In this light, the effect of introduction of the boundary slip\ninto the theory of propagation of elastic waves in a fluid-saturated porous\nmedium formulated by Biot is investigated. The new model should allow to fit\nthe experimental seismic data in circumstances when Biot's theory fails, as the\nintroduction of phenomenological dependence of the slip velocity upon\nfrequency, which is based on robust physical arguments, adds an additional\ndegree of freedom to the model. If fact, it predicts higher than the Biot's\ntheory values of attenuation coefficients of the both rotational and\ndilatational waves in the intermediate frequency domain, which is in\nqualitative agreement with the experimental data. Therefore, the introduction\nof the boundary slip yields three-fold benefits: (A) Better agreement of theory\nwith an experimental data since the parametric space of the model is larger\n(includes effects of boundary slip); (B) Possibility to identify types of\nporous medium and physical situations where boundary slip is important; (C)\nConstrain model parameters that are related to the boundary slip.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2002 17:50:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 May 2002 11:05:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
