In this\ninitial study, we focus on the $m=2$ (or bar) mode, which is shown to be\nunstable during the dynamic collapse phase of cloud evolution after the central\nregion has become magnetically supercritical. We find that, despite the\npresence of a strong magnetic field, the bar can grow fast enough that for a\nmodest initial perturbation (at 5% level) a large aspect ratio is obtained\nduring the isothermal phase of cloud collapse. The highly elongated bar is\nexpected to fragment into small pieces during the subsequent adiabatic phase.\nOur calculations suggest that the strong magnetic fields observed in some\nstar-forming clouds and envisioned in the standard picture of single star\nformation do not necessarily suppress bar growth and fragmentation; on the\ncontrary, they may actually promote these processes, by allowing the clouds to\nhave more than one (thermal) Jeans mass to begin with without collapsing\npromptly. Nonlinear growth of the bar mode in a direction perpendicular to the\nmagnetic field, coupled with flattening along field lines, leads to the\nformation of supercritical cores that are triaxial in general.

In the second and third series, prior to testing the specimens\nare annealed at 130 C for 4 and 24 hours, respectively. Constitutive equations\nare derived for the time-dependent response of semicrystalline polymers at\nisothermal loading. A polymer is treated as an equivalent temporary network of\nmacromolecules bridged by junctions (physical cross-links, entanglements and\ncrystalline lamellae). Under loading, junctions slip with respect to their\npositions in the bulk material (which reflects the viscoplastic behavior),\nwhereas chains separate from their junctions and merge with new ones at random\ntimes (which reflects the viscoelastic response). The network is thought of as\nan ensemble of meso-regions (MR) with various activation energies for\ndetachment of chains from temporary nodes. Adjustable parameters in the\nstress-strain relations are found by fitting observations. Experimental data\ndemonstrate that the shape of the relaxation spectrum (characterized by the\ndistribution of MRs with various potential energies) is independent of\nmechanical factors, but is altered at annealing. For specimens not subjected to\nthermal treatment, the growth of longitudinal strain does not affect the volume\nfraction of active MRs and the attempt rate for detachment of chains from their\njunctons. For annealed samples, the concentration of active MRs increases and\nthe attempt rate decreases with strain. These changes in the time-dependent\nresponse are attributed to broadening of the distribution of strengths of\ncrystalline lamellae at annealing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jan 2002 09:29:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We review the recent developments in this field.\nWe demonstrate with a simple quantum-mechanical example that it is a very\nnatural property of quantum systems that a symmetry breaking effect which is\nimportant for the low-lying spectrum of the system, can become unimportant for\nthe highly-lying states; the highly lying states reveal a multiplet structure\nof nearly degenerate states. Using the well established concepts of\nquark-hadron duality, asymptotic freedom in QCD and validity of the operator\nproduct expansion in QCD we show that the spectral densities obtained with the\nlocal currents that are connected to each other via chiral transformations,\nvery high in the spectrum must coincide. Hence effects of spontaneous breaking\nof chiral symmetry in QCD vacuum that are crucially important for the low-lying\nspectra, become irrelevant for the highly-lying states. Then to the extent that\nidentifiable hadronic resonances still exist in the continuum spectrum at high\nexcitations this implies that the highly excited hadrons must fall into\nmultiplets associated with the representations of the chiral group. We\ndemonstrate that this is indeed the case for meson spectra in the large $N_c$\nlimit. All possible parity-chiral multiplets are classified for baryons and it\nis demonstrated that the existing data on highly excited $N$ and $\\Delta$\nstates at masses of 2 GeV and higher is consistent with approximate chiral\nsymmetry restoration. However new experimental studies are needed to achieve\nany definitive conclusions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jan 2002 14:29:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
