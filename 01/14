I outline\nthe marked differences between molecular gas in the inner kpc and outer disk of\nspiral galaxies in terms of gas surface densities, gas mass fractions,\nepicyclic frequencies, and velocity dispersions. One implication is that in the\ninner kpc, gravitational instabilities set in only at very high gas densities,\nbut once triggered they grow rapidly on a timescale of a few Myrs. This growth\ntimescale is now comparable to the lifetime of massive stars which destroy\nmolecular clouds and therefore, the fraction of gas converted into stars may be\nehhanced in the inner kpc. Furthermore, the high pressure, high turbulence ISM\nmay favor the formation of massive clusters. Most of the sample galaxies have\ndeveloped large gas concentrations inside the outer inner Lindblad resonance\n(OILR) of the large-scale stellar bar. I discuss the differences in SFR per\nunit mass of molecular gas or star formation efficiency (SFE) between the\nstarbursts and non-starbursts. The SFE is not a simple function of molecular\ngas content. In the starbursts, the local gas density is close to the Toomre\ncritical density for the onset of gravitational instabilities. Conversely, in\nthe non-starbursts, sub-critical densities and large local velocity gradients\nin the extended gas appear to inhibit SF in several gas-rich regions.

To be more\nspecific it is clarified why Shannon entropy is used as measure of classical\ninformation and after a brief review of quantum mechanics it is possible to\ndemonstrate why the density matrix is the main tool of quantum information\ntheory. Then von Neumann entropy is introduced and with its help a great\ndifference between classical and quantum information theory is presented:\nquantum entanglement. Moreover an information theoretic interpretation of\nquantum measurement is discussed. Data compression, error correction and noisy\nchannel transmission are simply demonstrated for both classical and quantum\ncases. Finally using the above theory quantum cryptography is reviewed and the\npossibility of a commercial device realizing it is explored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2002 15:28:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
