Fraction of noncentral galaxies in groups and\nclusters is estimated to be below 10% for late types and around 30% for early\ntypes. Using the luminosity dependence of the signal we find that for early\ntypes the virial halo mass M scales with luminosity as M \\propto L^1.4 in red\nbands above L*. This shows that the virial mass to light ratio is increasing\nwith luminosity for galaxies above L*, as predicted by theoretical models.

This large drop can be explained as a result of both a\nconcentrated dark matter profile and a significant stellar contribution to the\nrotation velocity at the optical radii. We model the stellar component with a\nthin rotationally supported disk or a Hernquist profile and use adiabatic dark\nmatter response model to place limits on the halo concentration as a function\nof the stellar mass to light ratio.

The inclusion of Population III\nobjects that cool through H2 line emission has only a minor impact on these\nresults: increasing the mean metallicity and filling factor by at most a factor\nof 1.4, and moving the dawn of the enrichment epoch to a redshift of\napproximately 14 at the earliest. Thus enrichment by outflowing galaxies is\nlikely to have been incomplete and inhomogeneous, biased to the areas near the\nstarbursting galaxies themselves. Models with a 10% star formation efficiency\ncan satisfactorily reproduce the nearly constant (2 < z < 5, Z approximately\n3.5 x 10^-4 solar) metallicity of the low column density Ly-alpha forest\nderived by Songaila (2001), an effect of the decreasing efficiency of metal\nloss from larger galaxies. Finally, we show that IGM enrichment is intimately\ntied to the ram-pressure stripping of baryons from neighboring perturbations.\nThis results in the suppression of at least 20% of the dwarf galaxies in the\nmass range 10^8.5 to 10^9.5 solar, in all models with filling factors greater\nthan 2%, and an overall suppression of approximately 50% of dwarf galaxies in\nthe most observationally-favored model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jan 2002 10:08:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Apr 2002 11:23:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
