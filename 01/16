The method does not\nrequire the stars to be normal or undistorted, and is not limited in its\napplicability to the well detached systems that have traditionally been\nconsidered. With this in mind we carry out semi-detached light curve solutions\nfor SMC binaries discovered by the OGLE collaboration, identify candidates for\ndistance estimation, and tabulate OGLE light curve solutions. We point out\nimportant advantages for semi-detached binaries as standard candles; (1) light\ncurve solutions can be strengthened by exploiting lobe-filling configurations,\n(2) only single-lined spectra may be needed because the mass ratio can often be\ndetermined from photometry, and (3) nearly all semi-detached binaries have\nsensibly circular orbits. We carry out simulations with synthetic data to show\nthat semi-detached binaries can often be reliably identified and to quantify\nthe accuracy of solutions. The simulations demonstrate two additional\nadvantages for semi-detached distance determination candidates; (4) the\nwell-known difficulty in distinguishing solutions with interchanged radii\n(aliasing) is much less severe for semi-detached than for detached binaries,\nand (5) the desirable condition of complete eclipse is identified with improved\nreliability.

The unified theory is based on the zero-energy\nuniverse and the space-object structures. Different universes in different\ndevelopmental stages are the different expressions of the space-object\nstructures. The unified theory is divided into five parts: the space-object\nstructures, cosmology, the periodic table of elementary particles, the galaxy\nformation, and the extreme force field. The space-object structures explain\nquantum mechanics, relativity, and the evolution of the universes. From the\nzero-energy universe, our universe starts with the 11D (dimensional) membrane\ndual universe followed by the 10D string dual universe and then by the 10D\nparticle dual universe, and ends with the asymmetrical light-dark dual\nuniverse. This 4-stage process goes on in repetitive cycles. Such 4-stage\ncosmology accounts for the origins of the four force fields. The theoretical\ncalculated percentages of dark energy, dark matter, and baryonic matter are\n72.8. 22.7, and 4.53, respectively, in agreement with observed values.\nAccording to the calculation, dark energy started in 4.47 billion years ago in\nagreement with the observed 4.71 +/- 0.98 billion years ago. The unified theory\nplaces all elementary particles in the periodic table of elementary particles\nwith the calculated masses in good agreement with the observed values,\nincluding the mass of the Higgs boson. It explains the inflation, the Big Bang,\nand the formation of various shapes of galaxies.

We explore this idea quantitatively with a simple\nmodel linking the concentration of cloud condensation nuclei to the varying\nionization rate due to cosmic rays. Among the predictions of the model is a\nvariation in global cloud optical thickness, or opacity, with cosmic-ray rate.\nUsing the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project database\n(1983-1999), we search for variations in the yearly mean visible cloud opacity\nand visible cloud amount due to cosmic rays. After separating out temporal\nvariations in the data due to the Mt.

We find that the fractional amplitude of the opacity variations\ndue to cosmic rays increases with cloud altitude, becoming approximately zero\nor negative (inverse correlation) for low clouds. Conversely, the fractional\nchanges in visible cloud amount due to cosmic rays are only\npositively-correlated for low clouds and become negative or zero for the higher\nclouds.
