In the first part of the paper, we\ndevelop logics for reasoning about cautiously merged beliefs of agents with\ndifferent degrees of reliability. The logics are obtained by combining the\nmulti-agent epistemic logic and multi-sources reasoning systems. Every ordering\nfor the reliability of the agents is represented by a modal operator, so we can\nreason with the merged results under different situations. The fusion is\ncautious in the sense that if an agent's belief is in conflict with those of\nhigher priorities, then his belief is completely discarded from the merged\nresult. We consider two strategies for the cautious merging of beliefs. In the\nfirst one, if inconsistency occurs at some level, then all beliefs at the lower\nlevels are discarded simultaneously, so it is called level cutting strategy.\nFor the second one, only the level at which the inconsistency occurs is\nskipped, so it is called level skipping strategy. The formal semantics and\naxiomatic systems for these two strategies are presented. In the second part,\nwe extend the logics both syntactically and semantically to cover some more\nsophisticated belief fusion and revision operators. While most existing\napproaches treat belief fusion operators as meta-level constructs, these\noperators are directly incorporated into our object logic language. Thus it is\npossible to reason not only with the merged results but also about the fusion\nprocess in our logics. The relationship of our extended logics with the\nconditional logics of belief revision is also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2002 02:43:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We find that for a\nlow fundamental scale the phase transition, which in standard four dimensional\nhybrid models usually ends inflation, is slow and there is second phase of\ninflation lasting for a large number of e-foldings. The density perturbations\non cosmologically interesting scales exit the Hubble radius during this second\nphase of inflation, and we find that their amplitude is far smaller than is\nrequired. We find that the duration of the second phase of inflation can be\nshort, so that cosmologically interesting scales exit the Hubble radius prior\nto the phase transition, and the density perturbations have the correct\namplitude, only if the fundamental scale takes an intermediate value. Finally\nwe comment briefly on the implications of an intermediate fundamental scale for\nthe production of primordial black holes and baryogenesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2002 20:11:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 2002 12:54:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
