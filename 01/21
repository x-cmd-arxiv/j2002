We obtained 6-15 micron imaging\nobservations in six narrow bands for nine elliptical galaxies; every galaxy is\ndetected in every band. For wavelengths shorter than 9 microns, the spectra are\nwell matched by a blackbody, originating from the K and M stars that dominate\nthe integrated light of elliptical galaxies. However, at wavelengths between 9\nand 15 microns, the galaxies display excess emission relative to the stellar\nphotospheric radiation.

The varying radiative stresses on the inner disk exerted by the flux due\nto the quasi-periodic nuclear burning lead to changes in the inner disk radius\nand hence to the observed anti-correlation between kHz QPO frequency and X-ray\ncount rate. There is a time lag of about ten seconds of the X-ray count rate\nrelative to the kHz QPO frequency in terms of the anti-correlation we found\nbetween these two quantities, which could be caused by the propagation of the\nnuclear burning front on the neutron star away from the equatorial region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jan 2002 10:47:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It\nis shown that slightly generalized classical Maxwell electrodynamics can\ndescribe the intraatomic phenomena with the same success as relativistic\nquantum mechanics can do. Group-theoretical grounds for the description of\nfermionic states by bosonic system are presented briefly. The advantages of\ngeneralized electrodynamics in intraatomic region in comparison with standard\nMaxwell electrodynamics are demonstrated on testing example of hydrogen atom.\nWe are able to obtain some results which are impossible in the framework of\nstandard Maxwell electrodynamics. The Sommerfeld - Dirac formula for the fine\nstructure of the hydrogen atom spectrum is obtained on the basis of such\nMaxwell equations without appealing to the Dirac equation. The Bohr postulates\nand the Lamb shift are proved to be the consequences of the equations under\nconsideration. The relationship of the new model with the Dirac theory is\ninvestigated. Possible directions of unification of such electrodynamics with\ngravity are mentioned.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jan 2002 07:48:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The\n``coordinate part'' of the Hamiltonian phase space is the Poisson manifold $M$\nand the Lie algebroid brackets are defined by means of the Poisson bivector.\nThe Lie algebroid action defined on $M$ can be lifted to the phase space. The\nmain observation is that the classical BRST operator has the same form as in\nthe case of the Lie groups action. Two examples are analyzed. In the first, $M$\nis the space of $SL(3,C)$-opers on Riemann curves with the Adler-Gelfand-Dikii\nbrackets. The corresponding Hamiltonian system is the $W_3$-gravity. Its phase\nspace is the base of the algebroid bundle. The sections of the bundle are the\nsecond order differential operators on Riemann curves. They are the gauge\nsymmetries of the theory. The moduli space of $W_3$ geometry of Riemann curves\nis the symplectic quotient with respect to their action. It is demonstrated\nthat the nonlinear brackets and the second order differential operators arise\nfrom the canonical brackets and the standard gauge transformations in the\nChern-Simons field theory, as a result of the partial gauge fixing. The second\nexample is $M=C^4$ endowed with the Sklyanin brackets. The symplectic reduction\nwith respect to the algebroid action leads to a generalization of the rational\nCalogero-Moser model. As in the previous example the Sklyanin brackets can be\nderived from a ``free theory.''

The influence of\nfinal-state interactions and meson-exchange currents is discussed. The\n$p_m$-dependence of the data is reasonably well described by all calculations.\nHowever, the most advanced Faddeev calculations, which employ the AV18\nnucleon-nucleon interaction and include MEC, overestimate the measured cross\nsections, especially the longitudinal part, and at the larger values of $q$.\nThe diagrammatic approach gives a fair description of the cross section, but\nunder(over)estimates the longitudinal (transverse) structure function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jan 2002 11:36:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Mar 2002 13:30:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}
