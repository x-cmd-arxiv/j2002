From the data analysis of the\nfirst pointing Vikhlinin et al. reported the discovery of a prominent cold\nfront which is interpreted as the boundary of a cool gas cloud moving through\nthe hotter ambient gas. Vikhlinin et al. discussed the role of the magnetic\nfields in maintaining the apparent dynamical stability of the cold front over a\nwide sector at the forward edge of the moving cloud and suppressing transport\nprocesses across the front. In this Letter, we identify two new features in the\nX-ray image of A3667: i) a 300 kpc arc-like filamentary X-ray excess extending\nfrom the cold gas cloud border into the hotter ambient gas; ii) a similar\narc-like filamentary X-ray depression that develops inside the gas cloud. The\ntemperature map suggests that the temperature of the filamentary excess is\nconsistent with that inside the gas cloud while the temperature of the\ndepression is consistent with that of the ambient gas. We suggest that the\nobserved features represent the first evidence for the development of a large\nscale hydrodynamic instability in the cluster atmosphere resulting from a major\nmerger. This result confirms previous claims for the presence of a moving cold\ngas cloud into the hotter ambient gas. Moreover it shows that, although the gas\nmixing is suppressed at the leading edge of the subcluster due to its magnetic\nstructure, strong turbulent mixing occurs at larger angles to the direction of\nmotion.

This implies long viscous and\ndust evolution timescales, although dust must have grown to sizes of order ~1cm\nto explain the sub-mm and mm spectral slopes. In contrast, the negligible\nnear-infrared excess emission of this system requires that the disk be\noptically thin inside ~4 AU.This inner region cannot be completely evacuated;\nwe need ~0.5 lunar mass of ~1 micron particles remaining to produce the\nobserved 10 micron silicate emission. Our model requires a distinct transition\nin disk properties at ~4 AU, separating the inner and outer disk. The inner\nedge of the optically-thick outer disk must be heated almost frontally by the\nstar to account for the excess flux at mid-IR wavelengths. We speculate that\nthis truncation of the outer disk may be the signpost of a developing gap due\nto the effects of a growing protoplanet; the gap is still presumably evolving\nbecause material still resides in it, as indicated by the silicate emission,\nthe molecular hydrogen emission, and by the continued accretion onto the\ncentral star (albeit at a much lower rate than typical of younger T Tauri\nstars).

A finite linewidth in general has\nintrinsic and extrinsic sources. At low temperatures and outside the region\nwhere electron-phonon interaction occurs, the only intrinsic damping mechanism\nis provided by electron-electron interaction. This kind of intrinsic damping\ncan be described within time-dependent density-functional theory (TDFT), but\none needs to go beyond the adiabatic approximation and include retardation\neffects. It was shown previously that a density-functional response theory that\nis local in space but nonlocal in time has to be constructed in terms of the\ncurrents, rather than the density. This theory will be reviewed in the first\npart of this paper. For quantitatively accurate linewidths, extrinsic\ndissipation mechanisms, such as impurities or disorder, have to be included. In\nthe second part of this paper, we discuss how extrinsic dissipation can be\ndescribed within the memory function formalism. We first review this formalism\nfor homogeneous systems, and then present a synthesis of TDFT with the memory\nfunction formalism for inhomogeneous systems, to account simultaneously for\nintrinsic and extrinsic damping of collective excitations. As example, we\ncalculate frequencies and linewidths of intersubband plasmons in a 40 nm wide\nGaAs/AlGaAs quantum well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jan 2002 22:12:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Besides the area only one geometric\nquantity enters in these estimates, the spin-cut-diameter which depends on the\nchoice of spin structure. It can be expressed in terms of various distances on\nthe surfaces or, alternatively, by stable norms of certain cohomology classes.\nIn case of the 2-torus we obtain a positive lower bound for all Riemannian\nmetrics and all nontrivial spin structures. The corresponding estimate also\nholds for the $L^2$-spectrum of the Dirac operator on a noncompact complete\nsurface of finite area. As a corollary we get positive lower bounds on the\nWillmore integral for all 2-tori embedded in $R^3$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jan 2002 18:08:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
