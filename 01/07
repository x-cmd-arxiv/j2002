The X-ray spectra were typical of accreting pulsars,\ndescribable by a cut-off power-law, with an emission line near the 6.4 keV of K\nalpha fluorescence from cool iron. The equivalent width of this emission did\nnot share the orbital modulation, but nearly doubled during the faint phase,\ndespite little change in the column density. The outburst could have been\ncaused by an episode of increased wind from a Be star, such that a small\naccretion disk is formed during each periastron passage.
