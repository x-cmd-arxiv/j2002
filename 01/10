In the frequently used diagrams involving\n[OIII]5007/Hbeta, [OI]6300/Halpha, [NII]6584/Halpha and [SII]6716,6731, the\neffect of varying the shock-photoionization balance mimics a variation of the\nionization parameter (U) in traditional photoionization sequences.

The outer\nregions of galaxies both as observed and as simulated have density profiles\nsteeper than the self-similar profile. Nevertheless there appears to be an\nintermediate region in most galaxies in which the inverse square behaviour is a\ngood description.

As an example, we consider the system of the\n$CuO$ plane in the copper-oxide superconductors and we propose an array of\nelectrostatically confined quantum dots to be used as its dedicated quantum\nsimulator.

The Raman fields can be described by an effective two photon field\nhaving wave vector 2 k, where k is the propagation vector of one of the fields.\nBy combining this Raman field with {\\em another} Raman field having propagation\nvector -2 k, one, in effect, creates a standing wave Raman field\n\\label{91}%which whose ``intensity'' varies as $\\cos (4 k\\cdot r).$ When atoms\nmove through this standing wave field, atom gratings having period $\\lambda /4$\nare produced, with the added possibility that the total ground state population\nin a given ground state manifold can have $\\lambda /8$ periodicity. The\nconditions required to produce such gratings are derived. Moreover, it is shown\nthat even higher order gratings having periodicity smaller than $\\lambda /8$\ncan be produced using a multicolor field geometry involving three (two-photon)\nRaman fields. Although most calculations are carried out in the Raman-Nath\napproximation, the use of Raman fields to create reduced period optical\nlattices is also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jan 2002 17:11:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Feb 2002 21:08:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In the absence of\ncounter-charges, a charged, knotted string evolving along the energy gradient\nof electrostatic repulsion would progressively tighten its knotted domain into\na point on a perfectly circular string. However, in the presence of charge\nscreeningthe self-repelling knotted strings can get stabilised. It is known\nthat energy functionals in which repulsive forces between repelling charges\ngrow inversely proportional to the third or higher power of their relative\ndistance stabilise self-repelling knots. Especially interesting is the case of\nthe third power since the repulsive energy becomes scale invariant and does not\nchange upon Moebius transformations (reflections in spheres) of knotted\ntrajectories. We observe here thatknots minimising their repulsive Moebius\nenergy show quantization of the energy and writhe (measure of chirality) within\nseveral tested families of knots.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2002 11:51:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
