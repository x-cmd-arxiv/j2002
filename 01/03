Each p-point identity of rank r\ninvolves a cyclic homogeneous polynomial of degree r (in Jacobi elliptic\nfunctions with p equally spaced arguments) related to other cyclic homogeneous\npolynomials of degree r-2 or smaller. Identities corresponding to small values\nof p,r are readily established algebraically using standard properties of\nJacobi elliptic functions, whereas identities with higher values of p,r are\neasily verified numerically using advanced mathematical software packages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jan 2002 00:12:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Jan 2002 20:53:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
