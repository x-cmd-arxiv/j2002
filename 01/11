Besides, using a simple model of a single spin\ninteracting with a spin-bath, it is seen how decoherence, with the off-diagonal\nterms in the density matrix going to zero, can be obtained when the number of\nthe spins in the bath is taken to go formally to infinity. In this case,\nindeed, the system appears to flop at a frequency being formally infinity that,\nfrom a physical standpoint, can be proved equivalent to a time average.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2002 19:54:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-04"}

It is therefore of importance to simulate quantum\nalgorithms and circuits on the existing computers. However, for a large-size\nproblem, the simulation often requires more computational power than is\navailable from sequential processing. Therefore, the simulation methods using\nparallel processing are required.\n  We have developed a general-purpose simulator for quantum computing on the\nparallel computer (Sun, Enterprise4500). It can deal with up-to 30 qubits. We\nhave performed Shor's factorization and Grover's database search by using the\nsimulator, and we analyzed robustness of the corresponding quantum circuits in\nthe presence of decoherence and operational errors. The corresponding results,\nstatistics and analyses are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jan 2002 04:52:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}
