The buildup of angular momentum is modeled via dynamical friction and\ntidal stripping in a sequence of mergers. We demonstrate how over-cooling in\nincoming halos leads to a transfer of angular momentum from the baryons to the\ndark matter, in conflict with observations. By incorporating a simple recipe of\nsupernova feedback, we are able to solve the problems of angular momentum in\ndisk formation. Gas removal from the numerous small incoming halos, which merge\nto become the low specific angular momentum (j) component of the product,\neliminates the low-j baryons. Heating and puffing-up of the gas in larger\nincoming halos, combined with efficient tidal stripping, reduces the angular\nmomentum loss of baryons due to dynamical friction. Dependence of the feedback\neffects on the progenitor halo mass implies that the spin of baryons is\ntypically higher for lower mass halos. The observed low baryonic fraction in\ndwarf galaxies is used to calibrate the characteristic velocity associated with\nsupernova feedback, yielding ~100 km/s, within the range of theoretical\nexpectations. We then find that the model naturally produces the observed\ndistribution of the spin parameter among dwarf and bright disk galaxies, as\nwell as the j profile inside these galaxies.

Big variety of structural\nschemata in use today often requires much flexibility from applications--for\nexample, to process information coming from different sources. To ensure\napplication interoperability, translators are needed that can convert one\nstructure into another. This paper puts forward a formal data model aimed at\nsupporting hierarchical data processing in a simple and flexible way. The model\nis based on and extends results of two classical theories, studying finite\nstring and tree automata. The concept of finite automata and regular languages\nis applied to the case of arbitrarily structured tree-like hierarchical data\nrecords, represented as \"structured strings.\" These automata are compared with\nclassical string and tree automata; the model is shown to be a superset of the\nclassical models.

Attempts to study the neural\ncoding of these natural signals face challenges both in the selection of the\nsignal ensemble and in the analysis of the resulting neural responses. For\nzebra finches, naturalistic stimuli can be defined as sounds that they\nencounter in a colony of conspecific birds. We assembled an ensemble of these\nsounds by recording groups of 10-40 zebra finches, and then analyzed the\nresponse of single neurons in the songbird central auditory area (field L) to\ncontinuous playback of long segments from this ensemble.\n  Following methods developed in the fly visual system, we measured the\ninformation that spike trains provide about the acoustic stimulus without any\nassumptions about which features of the stimulus are relevant. Preliminary\nresults indicate that large amounts of information are carried by spike timing,\nwith roughly half of the information accessible only at time resolutions better\nthan 10 ms; additional information is still being revealed as time resolution\nis improved to 2 ms. Information can be decomposed into that carried by the\nlocking of individual spikes to the stimulus (or modulations of spike rate) vs.\nthat carried by timing in spike patterns. Initial results show that in field L,\ntemporal patterns give at least ~20% extra information. Thus, single central\nauditory neurons can provide an informative representation of naturalistic\nsounds, in which spike timing may play a significant role.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Jan 2002 06:50:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
