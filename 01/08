Furthermore, this benchmark value for $^{208}$Pb\nwill provide a calibration for hadronic probes, such as proton scattering,\nwhich can then be used to measure neutron densities of many exotic nuclei.

In the system under study, the fluid phase\nconsists of a two-component mixture of hard spheres of differing size, with a\nsize ratio $\\alpha=0.414$. At low pressures this fluid coexists with a pure fcc\ncrystal of the larger particles in which the small particles are immiscible.\nFor two interfacial orientations, [100] and [111], the structure and dynamics\nwithin the interfacial region is studied and compared with previous simulations\non single component hard-sphere interfaces. Among a variety of novel\nproperties, it is observed that as the interface is traversed from fluid to\ncrystal the diffusion constant of the larger particle vanishes before that of\nthe small particle defining a region of the interface where the large particles\nare frozen in their crystal lattice, but the small particles exhibit\nsignificant mobility. This behavior was not seen in previous binary hard-sphere\ninterface simulations with less asymmetric diameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2002 20:45:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Jan 2002 16:44:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

As an example, we consider the most general solutions of such particles\nmoving in a rotating magnetic field. If the parameters of the system are\nappropriately chosen, all solutions are cyclic. The nonadiabatic geometric\nphase and the solid angle are both calculated explicitly. It turns out that the\nnonadiabatic geometric phase contains an extra term in addition to the one\nproportional to the solid angle. The extra term vanishes automatically for spin\n1/2. For higher spin, however, it depends on the initial condition. We also\nconsider the valence electron of an alkaline atom. For cyclic solutions with\nspecial initial conditions in an arbitrary strong magnetic field, we prove that\nthe nonadiabatic geometric phase is a linear combination of the two solid\nangles subtended by the traces of the orbit and spin angular momenta.
