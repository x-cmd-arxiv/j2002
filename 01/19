How\nshould that return depend upon other people's behavior? What principles can you\nuse to answer these questions? In this paper, we approach these topics by\nexploring the consequences of two simple hypotheses about risk.\n  The first is a common-sense invariance principle: assets with the same\nperceived risk must have the same expected return. The second hypothesis\nconcerns the perception of time. We conjecture that in times of speculative\nexcitement, short-term investors may instinctively imagine stock prices to be\nevolving in a time measure different from that of calendar time. They may\ninstead perceive and experience the risk and return of a stock in intrinsic\ntime, a dimensionless time scale that counts the number of trading\nopportunities that occur.\n  The most noteworthy result is that, in the short-term, a stock's trading\nfrequency affects its expected return. We show that short-term stock\nspeculators will expect returns proportional to the temperature of a stock,\nwhere temperature is defined as the product of the stock's traditional\nvolatility and the square root of its trading frequency. We hope that this\nmodel will have some relevance to the behavior of investors expecting\ninordinate returns in highly speculative markets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jan 2002 22:13:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-02"}

In this paper the\nrelation between these two phenomena is explained and established. We start out\nby showing that the S-matrix of noncommutative field theories is hermitian\nanalytic. As a consequence, a noncommutative field theory is unitary if the\ndiscontinuities of its Feynman diagram amplitudes agree with the expressions\ncalculated using the Cutkosky formulae. These unitarity constraints relate the\ndiscontinuities of amplitudes with physical intermediate states; and allow us\nto see how the IR/UV mixing may lead to a breakdown of unitarity. Specifically,\nwe show that the IR/UV singularity does not lead to the violation of unitarity\nin the space-space noncommutative case, but it does lead to its violation in a\nspace-time noncommutative field theory. As a corollary, noncommutative field\ntheory without IR/UV mixing will be unitary in both the space-space and\nspace-time noncommutative case. To illustrate this, we introduce and analyse\nthe noncommutative Lee model--an exactly solvable quantum field theory. We show\nthat the model is free from the IR/UV mixing in both the space-space and\nspace-time noncommutative cases. Our analysis is exact. Due to absence of the\nIR/UV mixing one can expect that the theory is unitary. We present some checks\nsupporting this claim. Our analysis provides a counter example to the generally\nheld beliefs that field theories with space-time noncommutativity are\nnon-unitary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jan 2002 20:55:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Jan 2002 15:40:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

A traditional modeling approach makes use of steady flow\napproximation or Bernoulli's law which is known to be invalid during VF\nopening. We present a new hydrodynamic semi-continuum system for VF motion. The\nairflow is modeled by a quasi-one dimensional continuum aerodynamic system, and\nthe VF by a classical lumped two mass system. The reduced flow system contains\nthe Bernoulli's law as a special case, and is derivable from the two\ndimensional compressible Navier-Stokes equations. Since we do not make steady\nflow approximation, we are able to capture transients and rapid changes of\nsolutions, e.g. the double pressure peaks at opening and closing stages of VF\nmotion consistent with experimental data. We demonstrate numerically that our\nsystem is robust, and models in-vivo VF oscillation more physically.
