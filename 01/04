The analysis in numerical models of the inherent structure\n(IS) trajectories -- the set of local minima visited by the liquid -- offers\nthe possibility of filtering out the vibrational component of the motion of the\nsystem on the potential energy surface and thereby resolving the slow\nstructural component more efficiently. Here we report an analysis of an IS\ntrajectory for a widely-studied water model, focusing on the changes in\nhydrogen bond connectivity that give rise to many IS separated by relatively\nsmall energy barriers. We find that while the system \\emph{travels} through\nthese IS, the structure of the bond network continuously modifies, exchanging\nlinear bonds for bifurcated bonds and usually reversing the exchange to return\nto nearly the same initial configuration. For the 216 molecule system we\ninvestigate, the time scale of these transitions is as small as the simulation\ntime scale ($\\approx 1$ fs). Hence for water, the transitions between each of\nthese IS is relatively small and eventual relaxation of the system occurs only\nby many of these transitions. We find that during IS changes, the molecules\nwith the greatest displacements move in small ``clusters'' of 1-10 molecules\nwith displacements of $\\approx 0.02-0.2$ nm, not unlike simpler liquids.\nHowever, for water these clusters appear to be somewhat more branched than the\nlinear ``string-like'' clusters formed in a supercooled Lennar d-Jones system\nfound by Glotzer and her collaborators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jan 2002 17:30:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

An even higher density of such matter seems\nto be gravitationally trapped in the Galaxy. Thus its direct detection is\ncentral to particle physics and cosmology. Current supersymmetric models\nprovide a natural dark matter candidate which is the lightest supersymmetric\nparticle (LSP). Such models combined with fairly well understood physics like\nthe quark substructure of the nucleon and the nuclear structure (form factor\nand/or spin response function), permit the evaluation of the event rate for\nLSP-nucleus elastic scattering. The thus obtained event rates are, however,\nvery low or even undetectable. So it is imperative to exploit the modulation\neffect, i.e. the dependence of the event rate on the earth's annual motion.\nAlso it is useful to consider the directional rate, i.e its dependence on the\ndirection of the recoiling nucleus. In this paper we study such a modulation\neffect both in non directional and directional experiments. We calculate both\nthe differential and the total rates using both isothermal, symmetric as well\nas only axially asymmetric, and non isothermal, due to caustic rings, velocity\ndistributions. We find that in the symmetric case the modulation amplitude is\nsmall. The same is true for the case of caustic rings. The inclusion of\nasymmetry, with a realistic enhanced velocity dispersion in the galactocentric\ndirection, yields an enhanced modulation effect, especially in directional\nexperiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jan 2002 11:07:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-17"}

Our technique extends a result of Ambainis, based on the idea that\nsuccessful computation of a function requires ``decoherence'' of initially\ncoherently superposed inputs in the query register, having different values of\nthe function. The number of queries is bounded by comparing the required total\namount of decoherence of a judiciously selected set of input-output pairs to an\nupper bound on the amount achievable in a single query step. We use an\nextension of this result to general weights on input pairs, and general\nsuperpositions of inputs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jan 2002 19:19:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Furthermore, the original protocol and the\nmodified protocol use the same amount of classical communication. Thus, under\nthe three conditions stated, remote state preparation requires at least as much\nclassical communication as teleportation, as Lo has conjectured [PRA 62 (2000)\n012313], which is twice the expected classical communication cost of some\nexisting nonoblivious protocols.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jan 2002 23:01:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
