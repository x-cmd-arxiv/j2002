However, a\nvery simple one parameter evolution model, with the peak luminosity varying as\nan exponential function of cosmic time, converts the flux vs. distance law of\nthe critical density matter-dominated model into that of the concordance\nOmega_matter = 0.3 flat vacuum-dominated model with an error no larger than\n0.03 mag over the range 0-2 in redshift. A grey dust model that matches this\naccuracy can easily be contrived but it still fails by overproducing the far-IR\nbackground or distorting the CMB. Models that involve oscillation between\nphotons and axions could emulate an exponential function of cosmic time without\nviolating these background constraints. Clearly a better and well-tested\nunderstanding of the Type Ia supernova explosion mechanism and the origin of\nthe correlation between the decay rate and luminosity is needed before any\neffort to reduce statistical errors in the supernova Hubble diagram to very\nsmall levels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Jan 2002 19:39:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The connection of this new kink and the conjectured $S$\nmatrix of the Gross-Neveu model is obscured at this point.

We show analytically that the\nquasi-equilibrium state predicts its own disappearance upon changing the model\nparameters in favor of the establishment of an inverse cascade regime with K41\nscaling. The latter regime is found where predicted, offering a useful model to\nstudy inverse cascades.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Jan 2002 08:48:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The carrier space of this quantization is the\npre-Hilbert space of smooth complex functions on the torus. A Hamiltonian of a\ncompletely integrable system in this carrier space has a countable spectrum. If\nit is degenerate, its eigenvalues are countably degenerate. We study\nnonadiabatic perturbations of this Hamiltonian by a term depending on classical\ntime-dependent parameters. It is originated by a connection on the parameter\nspace, and is linear in the temporal derivatives of parameters. One can choose\nit commuting with a degenerate Hamiltonian of a completely integrable system.\nThen the corresponding evolution operator acts in the eigenspaces of this\nHamiltonian, and is an operator of parallel displacement along a curve in the\nparameter space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Jan 2002 23:16:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
