Both\nthe free and the forced oscillations of the component are treated as linear,\nisentropic perturbations of a spherically symmetric star. Resonances between\ndynamic tides and free oscillation modes are taken into account by means of the\nformalism developed by Smeyers et al. (1998). The amplitude of the tidally\ninduced radial-velocity variations seen by the observer depends on the orbital\neccentricity and on the orbital inclination. The amplitude increases with\nincreasing orbital eccentricity and is most sensitive to the value of the\norbital inclination when 20 < i < 70. In the case of a 5 solar mass ZAMS star\nwith a 1.4 solar mass compact companion, it is shown that resonant dynamic\ntides can lead to radial-velocity variations with amplitudes large enough to be\ndetected in observations. The shape of the tidally induced radial-velocity\ncurves varies from very irregular for orbital periods away from any resonances\nwith free oscillation modes to sinusoidal for orbital periods close to a\nresonance with a free oscillation mode. Our investigation is concluded with an\napplication to the slowly pulsating B star HD 177863 showing the possibility of\nresonant excitation of a high-order second-degree g-mode in this star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jan 2002 16:41:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Comet 29P Schwassmann-Wachmann 1 was observed in outburst: we\ndetected ``spinning'' jet structures. A high level of dust production resulted\nin an unusually high Af\\rho=16600 cm. The spatial variations reached -77%, at\nthe minimum, due in part to a jet and a ring-like structure in 1 arcminute\ndistance from the nucleus. In comet C/2001 A2, we detected a strong\npost-perihelion increase of dust and gas activity, in which the C_2 profile\nbecame one magnitude brighter over a 3-day period. For comets C/2000 SV74 and\nC/2000 WM1, we present detailed pre-perihelion spectrophotometry and\nmorphological information. Comet C/2000 SV74 showed high dust production\n(Af\\rho=1479 cm). Its coma suggests a steady-state outflow of material, while\nthe low contribution of spatial variations support high level activity. The\ncoma of C/2000 WM1 is dominated by solar effects, and CO+ forms the bulk of its\ngas activity. Despite its large heliocentric distance, we observed a nice tail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Jan 2002 14:19:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
