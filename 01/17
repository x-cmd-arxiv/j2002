This process then allows low- and\nintermediate-mass stars to achieve a ``standard'' thermally pulsing AGB\nphase... In the 7Mo model, the CNO envelope abundance following the second\ndredge-up is so large that the star does not experience the carbon injection\nepisode and follows a more standard thermally pulsing AGB evolution. Our\ncomputations also indicate that, thanks to a small overshooting at the base of\nthe convective envelope, the third dredge-up is already operating in stars with\nM >~1.5 Mo after a few pulses, and that by the end of our modeling, hot bottom\nburning is activated in stars more massive than ~ 2Mo. This evolutionary\nbehavior suggests that primordial low- and intermediate stars could have been\nsignificant contributors to the production of primary 12C, 14N, and may have\ncontributed to some extent to the production of Mg and Al and possibly\ns-elements (despite the lack of iron seeds) in the early universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jan 2002 10:08:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-16"}

We then present a new class of defects - drum vortons - which arise\nwhen a small symmetry breaking term is added to the potential. We display these\npoints within the context of the O(4) sigma model, relevant for hadrodynamics\nbelow the QCD scale. This model admits `embedded defects' (topological defect\nconfigurations of a simpler - in this case O(2) symmetric - model obtained by\nimposing an embedding constraint) that are unstable in the full model at zero\ntemperature, but that can be stabilised (by electromagnetic coupling to\nphotons) in a thermal gas at moderately high termperatures. It is shown here\nthat below the embedded defect stabilisation threshold, there will still be\nstabilized cosmic string defects. However, they will not be of the symmetric\nembedded vortex type, but of an `asymmetric' vortex type, and are automatically\nsuperconducting. In the presence of weak symmetry breaking terms, such as arise\nnaturally when using the O(4) model for hadrodynamics, the strings become the\nboundary of a new kind of cosmic sigma membrane, with tension given by the pion\nmass. The string current would then make it possible for a loop to attain a\n(classically) stable equilibrium state that differs from an ``ordinary'' vorton\nstate by the presence of a sigma membrane stretched across it in a drum like\nconfiguration.

We discuss in detail the dynamics of a brane\nembedded in two specific 10D bulk spacetimes, namely Sch-AdS$_5 \\times$S$_5$\nand a rotating black hole, and from the dynamics--which are now rather more\ncomplicated since the brane can move in all the extra dimensions--determine the\nnew ``dark fluid'' terms in the brane Friedmann equation.
