Ten years before, IRAS had unveiled a population\nof luminous IR galaxies exhibiting such a ``shy'' behavior, the so-called LIGs\nand ULIGs (with 12 < log(L[IR]/Lsol < 11 and L[IR]/Lsol > 12 respectively),\nwhich are responsible for the shape of the bolometric luminosity function of\nlocal galaxies above ~ 10^11 Lsol.

These systems are found over a path length of Delta z = 0.984,\nconstituting one of the highest densities per unit redshift of C IV absorption\never observed. One of the C IV systems is trough-like and resembles a weak\nBAL-type outflow. Two of the C IV are ``associated'' absorption systems with\n|v|<3000 km/s. Of the 11 remaining systems with v>3000 km/s, eight are either\nresolved or require multiple discrete systems to fit the line profiles.

The overdensity of C IV absorption spans a redshift range of Delta\nz=1.

While this is often true, it\nis not a general property and therefore requires a proof because simple formal\nmanipulations ignore the unavoidable divergences of perturbation theory. The\nexistence of invariant regularizations allows solving the problem in most cases\nbut the combination of gauge symmetry and chiral fermions leads to subtle\nissues. Depending on the specific group and field content, anomalies are found:\nobstructions to the quantization of chiral gauge symmetries.Because anomalies\ntake the form of local polynomials in the fields, are linked to local group\ntransformations, but vanish for global (rigid) transformations they have a\ntopological character.In these notes we review various perturbative and\nnon-perturbative regularization techniques, and show that they leave room for\npossible anomalies when both gauge fields and chiral fermions are present. We\ndetermine the form of anomalies in simple examples. We relate anomalies to the\nindex of the Dirac operator in a gauge background. We exhibit gauge instantons\nthat contribute to the anomaly in the example of the CP(N-1) models and SU(2)\ngauge theories. We briefly mentioned a few physical consequences. For many\nyears the problem of anomalies had been discussed only within the framework of\nperturbation theory. New non-perturbative solutions based on lattice\nregularization have recently been proposed. We describe the so-called overlap\nand domain wall fermion formulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2002 13:45:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
