We distinguish case BA (in which mass transfer is initiated during\nhelium core burning) from case BB (onset of Roche-lobe overflow occurs after\nhelium core burning is terminated, but before the ignition of carbon). We found\nthat the remnants of case BA mass transfer from 1.5 - 2.9 M_sun helium stars\nare heavy CO white dwarfs. This implies that a star initially as massive as 12\nM_sun is able to become a white dwarf. CO white dwarfs are also produced from\ncase BB mass transfer from 1.5 - 1.8 M_sun helium stars, while ONe white dwarfs\nare formed from 2.1 - 2.5 M_sun helium stars. Case BB mass transfer from\nmore-massive helium stars with a neutron-star companion will produce a double\nneutron-star binary. We are able to distinguish the progenitors of type Ib\nsupernovae (as the high-mass helium stars or systems in wide orbits) from those\nof type Ic supernovae (as the lower-mass helium stars or systems in close\norbits). Finally, we derive a \"zone of avoidance\" in the helium star mass vs.\ninitial orbital period diagram for producing neutron stars from helium stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jan 2002 11:46:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

A barred structure is found in only 2 objects. Despite that early\nmorphological types are dominant in this sample, integrated (B-V) colors are\nvery blue. For instance, the SO galaxies show, on average, a (B-V)=0.78. This\neffect seems to be caused by the luminosity contribution of the active nucleus\nand/or the disk to the total luminosity of the galaxy. In the B band, the\ncontribution of the active galactic nucleus to the total luminosity of the\ngalaxy varies from 3% to almost 60% and the bulge to disk luminosity ratio\n(L_bulge/L_disk) ranges from 0.6 to 22.

The idea of the\nmethod is to generate an ensemble of classical fields which samples the Wigner\nfunction of the initial thermal density operator, and to evolve each field with\nthe Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE). In the first part of the paper we improve\nthe sampling technique over our previous work and we test its accuracy against\nthe exactly solvable model of the ideal gas. In the second part of the paper we\ninvestigate the conditions of validity of the TWM. For short evolution times\nthe time-dependent Bogoliubov approximation is valid for almost pure\ncondensates. The requirement that the TWM reproduces the Bogoliubov prediction\nleads to the constraint that the number of field modes must be smaller than the\nnumber of particles.For longer times the nonlinear dynamics of the noncondensed\nmodes plays an important role. To demonstrate this we analyse the case of a 3D\nspatially homogeneous Bose condensed gas and we test how well TWM reproduces\nBeliaev-Landau damping.We have identified the mechanism which limits the\nvalidity of the TWM: the initial classical fields, driven by the time-dependent\nGPE, thermalise to a classical field distribution at a temperature T_class\nlarger than the initial temperature T. When T_class significantly exceeds T a\nspurious damping is observed in the simulation. This leads to the second\ncondition for the TWM, T_class-T<<T, which requires that the maximum energy of\nthe Bogoliubov modes does not exceed a few k_B T.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2002 16:56:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2002 19:10:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2009 14:42:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

This suggests a model of\nHeterotic M-Theory, with a standard embedding of the spin connection in one of\nthe E8s, but with the visible sector now having the E8 that is unbroken at\nunification. The universe is pictured as a thick pipe, where the long direction\nof the pipe represents the four extended dimensions, the circumference\nrepresents a compact six-manifold, and the radial direction represents the\neleventh dimension. The inner radius of the pipe is about 10^{-19} metres, and\nthe outer radius of the pipe is about 10^{-14} metres. We live on the inner\nsurface of the pipe. The low-energy generation structure and the high mass of\nthe top quark follow from the breaking pattern, and gravity and the Yang-Mills\ninteractions are unified at about 1 TeV. Parity breaking must occur\nspontaneously in four dimensions, rather than being inherited from ten\ndimensions. The stability of the proton might be correlated with the entries in\nthe CKM matrix.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jan 2002 04:48:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The second is a\ntransition due to saturation quite similar to the conventional Bose-Einstein\n(BE) condensation in the ideal Bose gas. Due to repulsive interaction in\nnon-zero modes the model manifests a generalized type III, i.e., non-extensive\nBE condensation.
