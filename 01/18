We have\nmeasured the peak positions, widths and strengths of the individual, continuum\nsubtracted bands. Based on these measurements, we were able to order the\nspectra in sequence of decreasing crystalline silicate band strength. We found\nthat the strength of the emission bands correlates with the geometry of the\ncircumstellar shell, as derived from direct imaging or inferred from the shape\nof the spectral energy distribution. This naturally divides the sample into\nobjects that show a disk-like geometry (strong crystalline silicate bands), and\nobjects whose dust shell is characteristic of an outflow (weak crystalline\nsilicate bands). All stars with the 33.6 micron forsterite band stronger than\n20 percent over continuum are disk sources. We define spectral regions (called\ncomplexes) where a concentration of emission bands is evident, at 10, 18, 23,\n28, 33, 40 and 60 micron.

The vector meson mass\ndrops significantly in the medium due to the effects of the Dirac sea. In the\nvariational approach adopted in the present paper, these effects are taken into\naccount through a realignment of the ground state with baryon condensates. Such\na realignment of the ground state becomes equivalent to summing of the baryonic\ntadpole diagrams in the relativistic Hartree approximation (RHA). The\napproximation scheme adopted here goes beyond RHA to include quantum effects\nfrom the scalar meson and is nonperturbative and self--consistent. It includes\nmultiloop effects, thus corresponding to a different approximation as compared\nto the one loop approximation of including scalar field quantum corrections. In\nthe present work, we study the properties of the vector mesons in the hot and\ndense matter as modified due to such quantum correction effects from the baryon\nas well as scalar meson sectors. These medium modifications of the properties\nof the vector mesons are reflected, through the shifting and broadening of the\nrespective peaks, in the low mass dilepton spectra. There is broadening of the\npeaks due to corrections from scalar meson quantum effects as compared to the\nrelativistic Hartree approximation.
