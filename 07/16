As a first step to determine wind momenta we fit the P-Cygni\nprofiles of the resonance lines of N V, Si IV and C IV with standard methods,\nand derive terminal velocities for all of the STIS targets. From these lines we\nalso derive ionic stellar wind column densities. Our results are compared with\nthose obtained previously in Galactic supergiants, and confirm earlier claims\nof `normal' wind line intensities and terminal velocities in M31.

The condensates are defined as vacuum averages of the\noperators which arise due to nonperturbative effects. The important role of\ncondensates in determination of physical properties of hadrons and of their\nlow-energy interactions in QCD is underlined. The special value of quark\ncondensate, connected with the existence of baryon masses is mentioned. Vacuum\ncondensates induced by external fields are discussed. QCD at low energy is\nchecked on the basis of the data on hadronic tau-decay. In the theoretical\nanalysis the terms of perturbation theory (PT) up to alpha^3_s are accounted,\nin the operator product expansion (OPE) - those up to dimension 8. The total\nprobability of the decay tau->hadrons (with zero strangeness) and of the\ntau-decay structure functions are best described at alpha_s(m^2_tau) =\n0.330+-0.025.
