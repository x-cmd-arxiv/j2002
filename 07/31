The nucleon-nucleon force is described\nin terms of one- and two-pion exchange and local short distance operators,\nwhich depend explicitly and implicitly on the quark masses. The pion propagator\nbecomes Coulomb-like in the chiral limit and thus one has significant\nscattering in all partial waves. The pion-nucleon coupling depends implicitly\non the quark masses and we find that it becomes stronger in the chiral limit.\nThere is a further quark mass dependence in the S-wave four--nucleon couplings,\nwhich can be estimated by means of dimensional analysis. We find that nuclear\nphysics in the chiral limit becomes natural.

For a given set of background scales, the parameter\nspace can be covered by the plasma beta and drift wave collisionality. At large\nenough plasma beta the turbulence breaks out into ideal ballooning modes and\nsaturates only by depleting the free energy in the background pressure\ngradient. At high collisionality it finds a more gradual transition to\nresistive ballooning. At moderate beta and collisionality it retains drift wave\ncharacter, qualitatively identical to simple two dimensional slab models. The\nunderlying cause is the nonlinear vorticity advection through which the self\nsustained drift wave turbulence supersedes the linear instabilities, scattering\nthem apart before they can grow, imposing its own physical character on the\ndynamics. This vorticity advection catalyses the gradient drive, while\nsaturation occurs solely through turbulent mixing of pressure disturbances.\nThis situation persists in the whole of tokamak edge parameter space.
