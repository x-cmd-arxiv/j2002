In order to cope with\nthis problem, the concept of mediator has been introduced as a software\ncomponent providing intermediate services, linking data resources and\napplication programs, and making transparent the heterogeneity of the\nunderlying systems. In designing a mediator architecture, we believe that an\nimportant aspect is the definition of a formal framework by which one is able\nto model integration according to a declarative style. To this purpose, the use\nof a logical approach seems very promising. Another important aspect is the\nability to model both static integration aspects, concerning query execution,\nand dynamic ones, concerning data updates and their propagation among the\nvarious data sources. Unfortunately, as far as we know, no formal proposals for\nlogically modeling mediator architectures both from a static and dynamic point\nof view have already been developed. In this paper, we extend the framework for\namalgamated knowledge bases, presented by Subrahmanian, to deal with dynamic\naspects. The language we propose is based on the Active U-Datalog language, and\nextends it with annotated logic and amalgamation concepts. We model the sources\nof information and the mediator (also called supervisor) as Active U-Datalog\ndeductive databases, thus modeling queries, transactions, and active rules,\ninterpreted according to the PARK semantics. By using active rules, the system\ncan efficiently perform update propagation among different databases. The\nresult is a logical environment, integrating active and deductive rules, to\nperform queries and update propagation in an heterogeneous mediated framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jul 2002 07:50:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This propagator was recently employed\nto evaluate some basic condensates and their temperature dependence (in the\ncosmological context), which were all reproduced for $\\mu = 1GeV$ (termed the\n`confinement scale parameter'), in association with the QCD scale parameter\n$\\Lambda_{qcd}= 200 MeV$ [hep-ph/0109278]. This paper seeks to provide a formal\nbasis for the ratio $\\Lambda_{qcd} / \\mu$ by employing the minimality condition\nfor the $integrated$ effective action $\\Gamma$, up to the 2-loop level, using\nthe Cornwall-Jackiw formalism for composite operators. To that end the mass\nfunction $m(p)$, determined via the Schwinger-Dyson equation (as a zero of the\nfunctional derivative of $\\Gamma$ w.r.t $S_F'$), acts as a feeder, and the\nstationarity condition on $\\Gamma$ as function of $\\mu$ and $\\alpha_s(\\mu)$\ngives the ratio $\\Lambda /\\mu$ = 0.246, in fair accord with the value 0.20\ngiven above. Inclusion of a two-loop $\\Gamma$ is crucial for the agreement. \\\\\nKeywords: confinement scale, QCD effective action, minimality condition,\n$B$-field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jul 2002 07:13:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Dec 2002 19:13:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
