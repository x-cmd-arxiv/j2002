Models with n ~0.85 predict a factor\nof ~3 fewer subhalos at a fixed circular velocity than the standard $n = 1$\ncase. Although this level of reduction does not resolve the ``dwarf satellite\nproblem'', it does imply that the level of feedback required to match the\nobserved number of dwarfs is sensitive to the initial power spectrum.

Our model is applicable in\nthe case in which the thermalization time from SN is sufficiently long that\nspatial variations are relatively unimportant, an appropriate assumption for\nthe empirical parameters adopted here. The departure from a standard scenario\nof passive evolution implies significantly younger luminosity-weighted ages for\nthe stellar populations of low-mass galaxies at moderate redshifts, even though\nthe more physically meaningful mass-weighted ages are changed only slightly.\nSecondary bursts of star formation also lead to a natural explanation of the\nlarge scatter in the NUV-optical relation observed in clusters at moderate\nredshift and account for the population of E+A galaxies that display a\nspheroidal morphology.

The thermohydrolysis chemistry at the core of the primary\ncompetition is described. Essentially, the competition is between two\nnucleophiles, a molecule of water and an -OH group on C_6 of an end glucosyl\ncation, to form either a reducing chain fragment with the propensity to undergo\nthe bond-forming reactions that ultimately form char or a\nlevoglucosan-end-fragment that depolymerizes to volatile products. The results\nof this analysis suggest that promotion of char formation under thermal stress\ncan actually increase the production of flammable volatiles. Thus we would like\nto convey an important safety message in this paper: in some situations where\nheat and mass transfer is restricted in cellulosic materials, such as\nfurnishings, insulation, and stockpiles, the use of char-promoting treatments\nfor fire retardation may have the effect of increasing the risk of flaming\ncombustion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jul 2002 06:13:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
