Numerous\nsources for the EGRB have been proposed, but the two systems which are certain\nto make some contribution are active galaxies (blazars) as well as normal\ngalaxies. In this paper, we evaluate the contribution to the background from\nboth sources. The active galaxy contribution arises from unresolved blazars. We\ncompute this contribution using the Stecker-Salamon model. For normal galaxies,\nthe emission is due to cosmic-ray interactions with diffuse gas. Our key\nassumption here is that the cosmic-ray flux in a galaxy is proportional to the\nsupernova rate and thus the massive star formation rate, quantified\nobservationally by the cosmic star formation rate (CSFR). In addition, the\nexistence of stars today requires a considerably higher ISM mass in the past.\nUsing the CSFR to compute both these effects, we find that normal galaxies are\nresponsible for a significant portion (\\sim 1/3) of the EGRB near 1 GeV, but\nmake a smaller contribution at other energies. Finally, we present a \"minimal\"\ntwo-component model which includes contributions from both normal galaxies and\nblazars.

By using\nan effective model of Hubbard-type to describe these states, we investigate how\nan oscillatory electric field can drive the dynamics of a two-electron Wigner\nmolecule held in a square quantum dot. We find that, for certain combinations\nof frequency and strength of the applied field, the tunneling between various\ncharge configurations can be strongly quenched, and we relate this phenomenon\nto the presence of anti-crossings in the Floquet quasi-energy spectrum. We\nfurther obtain simple analytic expressions for the location of these\nanti-crossings, which allows the effective parameters for a given quantum dot\nto be directly measured in experiment, and suggests the exciting possibility of\nusing ac-fields to control the time evolution of entangled states in mesoscopic\ndevices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2002 12:22:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Oct 2002 17:05:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Calculated phonon spectra and the\nEliashberg functions $\\alpha^2 F$ indicate that conventional s-wave\nelectron-phonon coupling can definitely account for the appearance of the\nsuperconducting phase in hcp Fe. However, the observed change in the transition\ntemperature with increasing pressure is far too rapid compared with the\ncalculated results. For comparison with the linear response results, we have\ncomputed the electron-phonon coupling also by using the rigid muffin-tin (RMT)\napproximation. From both the LR and the RMT results it appears that\nelectron-phonon interaction alone cannot explain the small range of volume over\nwhich superconductivity is observed.

The re-assignment of Tg to\ntemperatures above the 150K crystallisation was vigorously contested [6]. Here\nwe use detailed anneal-and-scan studies of a hyperquenched inorganic glass,\nwhich does not crystallize on heating, to interpret the perplexing aspects of\nthe 136K water phenomenon.

This theory is a\nfar-reaching development of the special relativity theory. One of the main\nprinciples of the special relativity theory is that two physical systems that\nare moving relative to each other have different times and it is necessary to\nuse a correspondence between clocks in these systems to coordinate their times.\nSuch correspondence is established by means of electromagnetic signals. In\naccordance with this principle, it is postulated in the system theory of time\nthat each system has its own time. In some cases, two systems have the same\ntime. In other cases, times of systems are coordinated or correlated. However,\nthere are systems in which times are independent from one another.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2002 15:20:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It is claimed by some authors that a single particle prepared in a\nsuperposition of N+1 box locations and which is subject to a final\n``post-selection'' measurement corresponding to a different superposition can\nbe said to have occupied ``with certainty'' N boxes during the intervening\ntime. However, others have argued that under closer inspection, this surprising\nclaim fails to hold. Aharonov and Vaidman have continued their advocacy of the\nclaim in question by proposing a variation on the N-box experiment, in which\nthe boxes are replaced by shutters and the pre- and post-selected particle is\nentangled with a photon. These authors argue that the resulting ``N-shutter\nexperiment'' strengthens their original claim regarding the N-box experiment.\nIt is argued in this paper that the apparently surprising features of this\nvariation are no more robust than those of the N-box experiment and that it is\nnot accurate to say that the particle is ``with certainty'' in all N shutters\nat any given time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jul 2002 19:59:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2002 20:01:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 18 May 2004 18:36:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-03"}

Although it is well known\nthat certain gates on two-level quantum systems (qubits), such as the\ncontrolled-not (CNOT), are universal when assisted by arbitrary one-qubit\ngates, it has only recently become clear precisely what class of two-qubit\ngates is universal in this sense.
