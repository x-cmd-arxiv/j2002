The median number of QSOs in\neach composite is ~200, yielding typical S/N of ~100. For a given redshift\ninterval, the composite spectra cover a factor of over 25 in luminosity. Using\nthe composite spectra we have measured the equivalent widths (EWs) of the major\nbroad and narrow emission lines, and the CaII K absorption feature due to the\nhost galaxy of the AGN. Assuming a fixed host galaxy spectral energy\ndistribution (SED), the correlation between CaII K EW and luminosity implies\nLgal proportional to Lqso**{0.42+-0.05}. We find strong anti-correlations with\nluminosity for the EWs of [OII] and [NeV]. These provide hints to the general\nfading of the NLR in high luminosity sources which we attribute to the NLR\ndimensions becoming larger than the host galaxy. If average AGN host galaxies\nhave SEDs similar to average galaxies, then the observed narrow [OII] emission\ncould be solely due to the host galaxy at low luminosities (M_B~-20). We\nmeasure highly significant Baldwin effects for most broad emission lines (CIV,\nCIII], MgII, Hbeta, Hgamma) and show that they are predominantly due to\ncorrelations with luminosity, not redshift. We find that the Hbeta and Hgamma\nBalmer lines show an inverse Baldwin effect and are positively correlated with\nluminosity, unlike the broad UV lines. We postulate that this previously\nunknown effect is due to a luminosity dependent change in the the ratio of disk\nto non-disk continuum components (abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jul 2002 04:19:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

We use the real space renormalization\ngroup method to tackle the intrachain couplings, and a mean-field approximation\nto treat the interchain coupling. We show that in the non-dimerized chain,\ndisorder (represented by bond randomness) enhances the Neel order parameter; in\nthe dimerized chain which shows no magnetic ordering in the weak interchain\ncoupling limit without randomness, disorder can actually lead to long range\norder. Thus disorder is shown to lead to, or enhance the tendency toward long\nrange order, providing another example of the order-by-disorder phenomenon. We\nmake a qualitative comparison of our results with the observed phenomenon of\ndoping induced long range ordering in quasi-one-dimensional spin systems such\nas CuGeO_3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jul 2002 19:52:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 May 2003 18:38:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Using the\nsystem size as a control parameter, we circumvent the problem that there is no\ninstability threshold for an extended system in the absence of gravity. This\nway, the case without gravity becomes accessible to a weakly nonlinear\ntreatment. The dependence of the branch structure of solution space on the\nlevel of gravity (or density difference) is exhibited. In the zero-gravity\nlimit, we recover the solution branch obtained by Spencer and Meiron. A\ntransition from a supercritical to a subcritical bifurcation is observed as\ngravity is increased or the nonhydrostatic stress is decreased at fixed\ngravity. At given values of the system parameters, we find a discrete, possibly\ninfinite, set of solution branches. This is reminiscent of dendritic or\neutectic growth, where similar solution sets exist, of which only a particular\none is linearly stable. Despite the high order of our expansions, the approach\nis restricted to relatively small nondimensional amplitudes ($\\lesssim 0.2$), a\ndisadvantage we can overcome by a variational approach that will be discussed\nin a companion paper.

This equation is then used to analyze the\nstability properties of small perturbations on a stationary solution consisting\nof a constant amplitude wave with stochastic phase noise. The concomitant\ndispersion relation exhibits the phenomenon of Landau-like damping. However,\nthis damping differs from the classical Landau damping in which a Langmuir\nwave, interacting with the plasma electrons, loses energy. In the present\nprocess, the damping is non-dissipative and is caused by the resonant\ninteraction between an instantaneously-produced disturbance, due to the\nparametric interactions, and a partially incoherent Langmuir wave, which can be\nconsidered as a quasi-particle composed of an ensemble of partially incoherent\nplasmons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jul 2002 13:06:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

In\noptimization of estimation scheme, to find a lower bound to the error of the\nestimator is a very important step. So far, all the proposed tractable lower\nbounds use derivative of density matrix. However, sometimes, we are interested\nin quantities with singularity, e.g. concurrence etc. In the paper, lower\nbounds to a Mean Square Error (MSE) of an estimator are derived for a quantum\nestimation problem without smoothness assumptions. Our main idea is to replace\nthe derivative by difference, as is done in classical estimation theory. We\napplied the inequalities to several examples, and derived optimal estimator for\nsome of them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jul 2002 05:07:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Apr 2003 03:08:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 21 May 2004 12:31:03 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2004 23:53:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
