If the WIMP is a neutralino, with an annihilation\ncross-section predicted in minimal SUSY models for the lightest stable relic\nparticle, the central cusps and dense substructure seen in simulated halos may\nproduce a substantial flux of energetic gamma rays. We derive expressions for\nthe relative flux from such events in simple halos with various density\nprofiles, and use these to calculate the relative flux produced within a large\nvolume as a function of redshift. This flux peaks when the first halos\ncollapse, but then declines as small halos merge into larger systems of lower\ndensity. Simulations show that halos contain a substantial amount of dense\nsubstructure, left over from the incomplete disruption of smaller halos as they\nmerge together. We calculate the contribution to the flux due to this\nsubstructure, and show that it can increase the annihilation signal\nsubstantially. Overall, the present-day flux from annihilation events may be an\norder of magnitude larger than predicted by previous calculations.

The symmetries of this system\ninvolve the Weyl group of type B, generated by permutations and changes of sign\nof the coordinates. A new basis for symmetric functions as well as an explicit\ntransition matrix to the monomial basis is constructed. This basis leads to a\nbasis for invariant spherical harmonics. The determinant of the Gram matrix for\nthe basis in the natural inner product over the sphere is evaluated, and there\nis a formula for the evaluation of the basis elements at (1,1,...,1). When the\nunderlying parameter is specialized to zero, the basis consists of ordinary\nspherical harmonics with cube group symmetry, as used for wave functions of\nelectrons in crystals. The harmonic oscillator can also be considered as a\ndegenerate interaction-free spin Calogero model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2002 15:33:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Great care must be\ntaken in their calculation and use, especially in cases of limited statistics\nwhen often one-sided limits are quoted. In order to estimate the stability of\nthe confidence levels to addition of more data and/or change of cuts, we argue\nthat the variance of their sampling distributions be calculated in addition to\nthe limit itself. The square root of the variance of their sampling\ndistribution can be thought of as a statistical error on the limit. We thus\nintroduce the concept of statistical errors of confidence limits and argue that\nnot only should limits be calculated but also their errors in order to\nrepresent the results of the analysis to the fullest. We show that comparison\nof two different limits from two different experiments becomes easier when\ntheir errors are also quoted.
