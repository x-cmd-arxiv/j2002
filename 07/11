Our results depend crucially on whether we use the total\nionizing rate measured by the proximity effect technique or the lower\ndetermination from the flux decrement distribution of Ly alpha forest lines.\nAssuming a faint-end LF slope of 1.58 and the SDSS estimates of the bright-end\nslope and normalization, we find that the LF must break at M_B*=-24.2,-22.3,\n-20.8 at z=3,4, 5 if we adopt the lower ionization rate and assume no stellar\ncontribution to the background. The break must occur at M_B*=-20.6,-18.7, -18.7\nfor the proximity effect background estimate. These values brighten by as much\nas ~2 mag if high-z galaxies contribute to the background with an escape\nfraction of ionizing photons consistent with recent estimates: f_e=0.16. By\ncomparing to faint AGN searches, we find that the typically-quoted proximity\neffect estimates of the background imply an over-abundance of faint AGN (even\nwith f_e=1). Even adopting the lower bound on proximity effect measurements,\nthe stellar escape fraction must be high: f_e>0.2. Conversely, the lower flux-\ndecrement-derived background requires a limited stellar contribution: f_e<0.05.\nOur derived LFs together with the locally-estimated black hole density suggest\nthat the efficiency of converting mass to light in optically-unobscured AGN is\nsomewhat lower than expected, <0.05. Comparison with similar estimates based on\nX-ray counts suggests that more than half of all AGN are obscured in the\nUV/optical.

We derive a general exact analytic\nexpression which describes both microlensing and occultation in the case of\nspherical bodies with a source of uniform brightness and a non-relativistic\nforeground body. We also compute numerically the case of a source with\nquadratic limb-darkening. In the limit that the gravitational deflection angle\nis comparable to the angular size of the foreground body, both microlensing and\noccultation occur as the objects align. Such events may be used to constrain\nthe size ratio of the lens and source stars, the limb-darkening coefficients of\nthe source star, and the surface gravity of the lens star (if the lens and\nsource distances are known). Application of these results to microlensing\nduring transits in binaries and giant-star microlensing are discussed. These\nresults unify the microlensing and occultation limits and should be useful for\nrapid model fitting of microlensing, eclipse, and \"microccultation\" events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jul 2002 00:54:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Oct 2002 01:14:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The\ndynamics of the condensate squeezes and amplifies the quantum excitations,\nmixing the positive and negative frequency components of their wave functions\nthereby creating particles which appear as bursts and jets. By analyzing the\nchanging amplitude and particle content of these excitations, our simple\nphysical picture (based on a test field approximation) explains well the\noverall features of the Bose Novae phenomena and provide excellent quantitative\nfits with experimental data on several aspects, such as the scaling behavior of\nthe collapse time and the amount of particles in the jet. The predictions of\nthe bursts at this level of approximation is less than satisfactory but may be\nimproved on by including the backreaction of the excitations on the condensate.\nThe mechanism behind the dominant effect -- parametric amplification of vacuum\nfluctuations and freezing of modes outside of horizon -- is similar to that of\ncosmological particle creation and structure formation in a rapid quench (which\nis fundamentally different from Hawking radiation in black holes). This shows\nthat BEC dynamics is a promising venue for doing `laboratory cosmology'.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jul 2002 13:18:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 May 2003 14:14:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 29 Jul 2003 15:27:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
