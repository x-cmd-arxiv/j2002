The RGS spectrum exhibits a wealth of spectral features from\niron and oxygen. XMM-Newton data confirm the finding of previous Chandra\nHETGS/MEG observations that NLTE models of hot white dwarf atmospheres fail to\nrepresent the complex spectrum. There are clear evidences for P Cygni profiles\nwith wind velocities of up to 2000 km/s. Small flux variations with time scales\nlarger than 1000s are present. The strongest power is at ~ 0.21d, a period\nclose to that seen in V band optical light curves. A detailed analysis of the\nassociated changes in the RGS and EPIC pn spectra hint at a mostly grey\nmechanism suggesting a variation of the visibility of the white dwarf due to\nocculting material in the accretion disk. Finally, we detect radial velocity\nchanges of 173 +/- 47 km/s between two RGS observations obtained half an\norbital cycle apart. The amplitude of the RGS velocity shift is consistent with\nthat of the optical He II 4686 and thus supports the idea that most of the He\nII optical line emission arises from the accretion disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2002 05:44:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

They also display evidence for\ndeficiencies in carbon, but other metals have abundances typical of the SMC.\nGiven the number of B-type stars with low rotational projected velocities in\nNGC330 (all our targets have vsini < 50 km/s), we suggest that it is unlikely\nthat the stars in our sample are seen almost pole-on, but rather that they are\nintrinsically slow rotators.

Perhpas other\njewels may remain the work of this prescient genius. In a short paper in\n1957--coming shortly on the heels of the suggestion and experimental\nconfirmation of parity non-conservation by the weak force--Stueckelberg noted\nthat sine there exist completely antisymmetric four-tensors (e) with covariant\nderivative zero, non-parity conserving forces can readily be accomodated by\ngeneral relativity as the product of such a tensor and the non-parity\nconserving terms. Stueckelberg also pointed out that in classical general\nrelativity the covariant derivative, D, of e is De=(-g)^1/2*d[e(-g)^-1/2]=0,\nwhere g is the determinant of the metric tensor, and d is an ordinary\nderivative. Since g is non-zero, if g is constant, e is a constant and mean\nproper particle lifetimes are the same in all Lorenz frames. I point out that\nStueckelberg's paper has three further deep and important implications. (1) We\nsee how gravity-- matter--can influence particle lifetimes by forcing the e\ntensor to be non-constant to have to \"adjust\" so that d[e(-g)^-1/2] is zero,\nand we can get some quantitative feel for the magnitude of this effect. (2) If\nany difference in the lifetimes of particles and antiparticles are to occur, in\nthe absence of Lorenz invariance violation, it would be in regions where dg is\nnon-zero. (3) If indeed, differences in particle and antiparticle lifetimes are\nfound, before they can be ascibed to effects of quantum gravity, supersymmetry,\nor string theory, the effects of classical gravity need to be accounted for.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2002 00:20:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In contrast to the standard unitary neutrino oscillations these\neffects can be visible even for two flavour neutrino transitions and even if\none of the elements of the neutrino mixing matrix is equal to zero. They do not\nnecessarily vanish with $\\delta m^{2} \\to 0$ and they are different for various\npairs of flavour neutrino transitions ($\\nu_e \\to \\nu_\\mu$), ($\\nu_\\mu \\to\n\\nu_\\tau$), ($\\nu_\\tau \\to \\nu_e$). Neutrino oscillations in vacuum and Earth's\nmatter are calculated for some fixed baseline experiments and a comparison\nbetween unitary and non-unitary oscillations are presented. It is shown, taking\ninto account the present experimental constraints, that heavy neutrino states\ncan affect CP and T asymmetries. This is especially true in the case of\n$\\nu_\\mu \\to \\nu_\\tau$ oscillations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2002 07:33:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

On the other hand, in Felder's\ntalk, it is explained that another important equation of mathematical physics,\nthe star-triangle relation, may (and should) be viewed as a generalization of\nQYBE, in which solutions depend on additional ``dynamical'' parameters. It is\nalso explained there that to a solution of the quantum dynamical Yang-Baxter\nequation one may associate a kind of quantum group.
