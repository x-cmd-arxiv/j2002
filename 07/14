The outer planet is the first\nextrasolar planet found that orbits near or beyond the orbit of Jupiter. It was\ndrawn from a sample of ~50 stars observed with sufficient duration and quality\nto detect a giant planet at 5 AU, implying that such planets are not rare. The\nproperties of this jupiter analog may be compared directly to those of the\nJovian planets in our Solar System. Its eccentricity is modest, e=0.16,\ncompared with e=0.05 for both Jupiter and Saturn. Its mass is at least 4.0\njupiter masses (M sin i). The two planets do not perturb each other\nsignificantly. Moreover, a third planet of sub-Jupiter mass could easily\nsurvive in between these two known planets. Indeed a third periodicity remains\nin the velocity measurements with P = 44.3 d and a semi-amplitude of 13 m/s.\nThis periodicity is caused either by a third planet at a=0.24 AU or by\ninhomogeneities on the stellar surface that rotates with period 42 d. The\nplanet interpretation is more likely, as the stellar surface is quiet,\nexhibiting log(R'_{HK}) = -5.0 and brightness variations less than 1 millimag,\nand any hypothetical surface inhomogeneity would have to persist in longitude\nfor 14 yr. Even with all three planets, an additional planet of\nterrestrial--mass could orbit stably at ~1 AU. The star 55 Cancri is apparently\na normal, middle-aged main sequence star with a mass of 0.95 solar masses, rich\nin heavy elements ([Fe/H] = +0.27).

For a given number $N$ we construct periodic\n(i.e. covering) manifolds such that the essential spectrum of the corresponding\nLaplacian has at least $N$ open gaps. We use two different methods. First, we\nconstruct a periodic manifold starting from an infinite number of copies of a\ncompact manifold, connected by small cylinders. In the second construction we\nbegin with a periodic manifold which will be conformally deformed. In both\nconstructions, a decoupling of the different period cells is responsible for\nthe gaps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Jul 2002 09:22:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
