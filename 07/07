The ability of the\nturbulence to bend and fold the magnetic-field lines leads to the emergence of\na distinctive small-scale structure.

Using the best available input we determine the universal\nunitarity triangle for models with minimal flavour violation (MFV) and compare\nit with the one in the Standard Model. We present allowed ranges for $\\sin\n2\\beta$, $\\sin 2\\alpha$, $\\gamma$, $R_b$, $R_t$ and $\\Delta M_s$ within the\nStandard Model and MFV models. We also update the allowed range for the\nfunction $F_{tt}$ that parametrizes various MFV-models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Jul 2002 11:35:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2002 08:17:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2002 14:12:20 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 9 Dec 2002 07:49:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-23"}
