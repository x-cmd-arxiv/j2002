If\nthe soft excess is modeled as a separate black-body or thermal bremsstrahlung\ntype component, pulse phase resolved spectroscopy of SMC X-1 shows that the\nsoft component also has a pulsating nature.

The\npulsating soft component is found to have a nearly sinusoidal profile,\ndissimilar to the complex profile seen at higher energies, which can be an\neffect of smearing. Due to very high luminosity of these sources, the size of\nthe emission zone required for the soft component is large (radius ~300-400\nkm).

The third\ngroup (R = Tb, Dy and Ho) shows successive three phase transitions, the\nstructural, charge/orbital-order and magnetic transitions, as observed in\nYBaMn_{2}O_{6}. Comparing to the metal-disordered manganites\n(R^{3+}_{0.5}A^{2+}_{0.5})MnO_{3}, two remarkable features can be recognized in\nRBaMn_{2}O_{6}; (1) relatively high charge-order transition temperature and (2)\nthe presence of structural transition above the charge-order temperature in the\nthird group. We propose a possible orbital ordering at the structural\ntransition, that is a possible freezing of the orbital, charge and spin degrees\nof freedom at the independent temperatures in the third group. These features\nare closely related to the peculiar structure that the MnO_{2} square-lattice\nis sandwiched by the rock-salt layers of two kinds, RO and BaO with extremely\ndifferent lattice-sizes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2002 07:42:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Our main\nconcern is to investigate the influence of the nonlinearity of W(t) on the\nprobability P to remain in the initial state. The dimensionless quantity\nepsilon = pi Delta ^2/(2 hbar v) depends on the coupling Delta of both levels\nand on the sweep rate v. For fast sweep rates, i.e., epsilon << l and\nmonotonic, analytic sweep functions linearizable in the vicinity of the\nresonance we find the transition probability 1-P ~= epsilon (1+a), where a>0 is\nthe correction to the LSZ result due to the nonlinearity of the sweep. Further\nincrease of the sweep rate with nonlinearity fixed brings the system into the\nnonlinear-sweep regime characterized by 1-P ~= epsilon ^gamma with gamma neq 1\ndepending on the type of sweep function. In case of slow sweep rates, i.e.,\nepsilon >>1 an interesting interference phenomenon occurs. For analytic W(t)\nthe probability P=P_0 e^-eta is determined by the singularities of sqrt{Delta\n^2+W^2(t)} in the upper complex plane of t. If W(t) is close to linear, there\nis only one singularity, that leads to the LZS result P=e^-epsilon with\nimportant corrections to the exponent due to nonlinearity. However, for, e.g.,\nW(t) ~ t^3 there is a pair of singularities in the upper complex plane.\nInterference of their contributions leads to oscillations of the prefactor P_0\nthat depends on the sweep rate through epsilon and turns to zero at some\nepsilon.

Such effect takes place when the spins of the\nbinary members are misaligned with respect to the orbital angular momentum. As\na first step we assess the importance of precession specifically for the\nfirst-generation of LIGO detectors. We investigate the extent of the\nsignal-to-noise ratio reduction and, hence, detection rate that occurs when\nprecession effects are not accounted for in the template waveforms. We restrict\nour analysis to binary systems that undergo the so-called simple precession and\nhave a total mass close to 10 solar mass. We find that for binary systems with\nrather high mass ratios (e.g., a 1.4 solar mass neutron star and a 10 solar\nmass black hole) the detection rate can decrease by almost an order of\nmagnitude. Current astrophysical estimates of the rate of binary inspiral\nevents suggest that LIGO could detect at most a few events per year, and\ntherefore the reduction of the detection rate even by a factor of a few is\ncritical. In the second part of our analysis, we examine whether the effect of\nprecession could be included in the templates by capturing the main features of\nthe phase modulation through a small number of extra parameters. Specifically\nwe examine and tested for the first time the 3-parameter family suggested by\nApostolatos. We find that, even though these ``mimic'' templates improve the\ndetection rate, they are still inadequate in recovering the signal-to-noise\nratio at the desired level.

To fulfill the goal of being able to express a classical skyrmion as a\ncoherent state of baryons directly in terms of the baryon states, surprisingly\na combination of both collective coordinate approaches is required. To prepare\nfor the subsequent application to skyrmion formation through disoriented chiral\ncondensates in heavy ion collisions, the Skyrme model is rigorously quantized\nusing the Dirac prescription for constrained systems.

The model is a pure Z_2 gauge theory in which randomly\nchosen plaquettes (occuring with concentration p) have couplings with the\n``wrong sign'' so that magnetic flux is energetically favored on these\nplaquettes. Excitations of the model are one-dimensional ``flux tubes'' that\nterminate at ``magnetic monopoles.'' Electric confinement can be driven by\nthermal fluctuations of the flux tubes, by the quenched background of magnetic\nmonopoles, or by a combination of the two. Like the RBIM, the RPGM has enhanced\nsymmetry along a ``Nishimori line'' in the p-T plane (where T is the\ntemperature). The critical concentration p_c of wrong-sign plaquettes at the\nconfinement-Higgs phase transition along the Nishimori line can be identified\nwith the accuracy threshold for robust storage of quantum information using\ntopological error-correcting codes: if qubit phase errors, qubit bit-flip\nerrors, and errors in the measurement of local check operators all occur at\nrates below p_c, then encoded quantum information can be protected perfectly\nfrom damage in the limit of a large code block. Numerically, we measure p_{c0},\nthe critical concentration along the T=0 axis (a lower bound on p_c), finding\np_{c0}=.0293 +/- .0002. We also measure the critical concentration of\nantiferromagnetic bonds in the two-dimensional RBIM on the T=0 axis, finding\np_{c0}=.1031 +/-.0001. Our value of p_{c0} is incompatible with the value of\np_c=.1093 +/-.0002 found in earlier numerical studies of the RBIM, in\ndisagreement with the conjecture that the phase boundary of the RBIM is\nvertical (parallel to the T axis) below the Nishimori line.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jul 2002 20:18:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2002 18:00:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-20"}

We describe a general\nformalism which includes dispersive effects, such as group velocity and group\nvelocity dispersion (GVD). When dispersion is negligible, the analysis is\nespecially simple and insightful. We show that molecular oscillations result in\na modulated instantaneous susceptibility of the medium. The effect of the\ntime-varying susceptibility on a probe laser pulse is two-fold: the output\nfrequency becomes modulated because of the time-varying phase velocity, and the\npulse shape becomes deformed because of the time-varying group velocity. We\nidentify two mechanisms for pulse compression: (1) Frequency chirping with\nsubsequent pulse compression by normal linear GVD (possibly in the same medium)\nand (2) Compression due to the time-varying group velocity. We analyze various\naspects of pulse compression in the coherent Raman medium and derive\nconservation relations for this process. When we consider a probe laser pulse\nwhich is much shorter than the molecular oscillation period, we observe\nfrequency chirping, compression, or stretching of this pulse, depending on its\nrelative timing with respect to the molecular oscillations. Based on our\nanalysis, we propose a method for selective compression or frequency conversion\nof single ultrashort pulses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2002 02:38:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In this paper is presented a novel model in defence of\nmacroscopic quantum events within and between neural cells. The synaptic\nbeta-neurexin/neuroligin-1 adhesive protein complex is claimed to be not just\nthe core of the excitatory glutamatergic CNS synapse, instead it is a device\nmediating entanglement between the cytoskeletons of the cortical neurons. Thus\nthe macroscopic coherent quantum state can extend throughout large brain\ncortical areas and the subsequent collapse of the wavefunction could affect\nsimultaneously the subneuronal events in millions of neurons.
