In agreement\nwith previous studies, we find that relativistic jets are collimated by their\npassage through the stellar mantle. Interaction of these jets with the star and\ntheir own cocoons also causes mixing that sporadically decelerates the flow. We\nspeculate that this mixing instability is chiefly responsible for the variable\nLorentz factor needed in the internal shock model and for the complex light\ncurves seen in many GRBs. In all cases studied, the jet is shocked deep inside\nthe star following a brief period of adiabatic expansion. The jet that finally\nemerges from the star thus has a moderate Lorentz factor, modulated by mixing,\nand a very large internal energy. In a second series of calculations, we follow\nthe escape of that sort of jet. Because of the large ratio of internal to\nkinetic energy in both the jet and its cocoon, the opening angle of the final\njet is significantly greater than at breakout. A small amount of material\nemerges at large angles, but with a Lorentz factor still sufficiently large to\nmake a weak GRB.

Since the first\ndiscovery of X-ray sources theoretical analysis suggested that a high degree of\nlinear polarization could be expected due either to the, extremely non thermal,\nemission mechanism or to the transfer of radiation in highly asymmetric\nsystems. The actual implementation of this subtopic was, conversely, relatively\ndeceiving. This is mainly due to the limitation of the conventional techniques\nbased on the Bragg diffraction at 45deg, or on Thomson scattering around 90deg.\nAcually no X-ray Polarimeter has been launched since 25 years. Nevertheless the\nexpectations from such measurement on several astrophysical targets including\nHigh and Low Mass X-Ray Binaries, isolated neutron Stars, Galactic and\nExtragalactic Black Holes is extremely attractive. We developed a new technique\nto measure the linear polarization of X-ray sources. It is based on the\nvisualization of photoelectron tracks in a, finely subdivided, gas filled\ndetector (micropattern). The initial direction of the photoelectron is derived\nand from the angular distribution of the tracks the amount and angle of\npolarization is computed. This technique can find an optimal exploitation in\nthe focus of XEUS-1. Even in a very conservative configuration (basically the\nalready existing prototype) the photoelectric polarimeter could perform\npolarimetry at % level on many AGNs.

The probability\nof failure of the recovery operation is calculated for a variety of CSS codes,\nincluding large block codes and concatenated codes. Recent insights into the\nsyndrome extraction process, which render the whole process more efficient and\nmore noise-tolerant, are incorporated. The average number of recoveries which\ncan be completed without failure is thus estimated as a function of various\nparameters. The main parameters are the gate (gamma) and memory (epsilon)\nfailure rates, the physical scale-up of the computer size, and the time t_m\nrequired for measurements and classical processing. The achievable computation\nsize is given as a surface in parameter space. This indicates the noise\nthreshold as well as other information. It is found that concatenated codes\nbased on the [[23,1,7]] Golay code give higher thresholds than those based on\nthe [[7,1,3]] Hamming code under most conditions. The threshold gate noise\ngamma_0 is a function of epsilon/gamma and t_m; example values are\n{epsilon/gamma, t_m, gamma_0} = {1, 1, 0.001}, {0.01, 1, 0.003}, {1, 100,\n0.0001}, {0.01, 100, 0.002}, assuming zero cost for information transport.

We address\nthis question here. In particular, we consider the question of how mixed a\ntwo-level system and a field mode may be such that free entanglement arises in\nthe course of the time evolution according to a Jaynes-Cummings type\ninteraction. We investigate the situation for which the two-level system is\ninitially in mixed state taken from a one-parameter set, whereas the field has\nbeen prepared in an arbitrary thermal state. Depending on the particular choice\nfor the initial state and the initial temperature of the quantised field mode,\nthree cases can be distinguished: (i) free entanglement will be created\nimmediately, (ii) free entanglement will be generated, but only at a later time\ndifferent from zero, (iii) the partial transpose of the joint state remains\npositive at all times. It will be demonstrated that increasing the initial\ntemperature of the field mode may cause the joint state to become distillable\nduring the time evolution, in contrast to a non-distillable state at lower\ninitial temperatures. We further assess the generated entanglement\nquantitatively, by evaluating the logarithmic negativity numerically, and by\nproviding an analytical upper bound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jul 2002 17:17:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2016 10:47:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-02"}
