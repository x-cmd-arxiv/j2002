Unlike for galaxies, this allows the overall normalization\nof the power spectrum to be measured directly from the data, providing an extra\nconstraint on the models. In the context of CDM models, both the shape and\namplitude of the REFLEX P(k) require, consistently, a low value for the mean\nmatter density $\\Omega_M$.

Two distinct regions, which differ in\nboth their infall and their rotation properties, therefore seem to stand out:\nthe inner part of the envelope (r ~< 2000-4000 AU) is rapidly collapsing and\nrotating, while the outer part undergoes only moderate infall/contraction and\nslower rotation. These contrasted features suggest that angular momentum is\nconserved in the collapsing inner region but efficiently dissipated due to\nmagnetic braking in the slowly contracting outer region. We propose that the\ninner envelope is in the process of decoupling from the ambient cloud and\ncorresponds to the effective mass reservoir (~0.5 M_sun) from which the central\nstar is being built.

The\nrotation velocity profile we derive for the inner IRAM 04191 envelope should\nthus set some constraints on the distribution of angular momentum on the scale\nof the outer Solar system at the onset of protostar/disk formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2002 19:07:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

In reality, however, no\ninteraction is strong enough to enforce a boundary condition on all frequencies\nof a fluctuating field. We construct a more physical model of the situation by\ncoupling the fluctuating field to a smooth background potential that implements\nthe boundary condition in a certain limit. To study this problem, we develop\ngeneral new methods to compute renormalized one--loop quantum energies and\nenergy densities. We use analytic properties of scattering data to compute\nGreen's functions in time--independent background fields at imaginary momenta.\nOur calculational method is particularly useful for numerical studies of\nsingular limits because it avoids terms that oscillate or require cancellation\nof exponentially growing and decaying factors. To renormalize, we identify\npotentially divergent contributions to the Casimir energy with low orders in\nthe Born series to the Green's function. We subtract these contributions and\nadd back the corresponding Feynman diagrams, which we combine with counterterms\nfixed by imposing standard renormalization conditions on low--order Green's\nfunctions. The resulting Casimir energy and energy density are finite\nfunctionals for smooth background potentials. In general, however, the Casimir\nenergy diverges in the boundary condition limit. This divergence is real and\nreflects the infinite energy needed to constrain a fluctuating field on all\nenergy scales; renormalizable quantum field theories have no place for ad hoc\nsurface counterterms.

Both the classical and quantum\nversions of the Floquet operator are used to study the phase-space dynamics of\natomic stabilization, and the 'fringe structure' in the phase-space is clearly\ndemonstrated. Furthermore, we investigate the dynamical mechanism and\ncharacters of this striking structure, and find that this structure is very\nclosely related to the classical invariant manifolds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2002 16:26:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

After a short discussion this method is translated\nstep-by-step to a framework based on difference operators. To restrict the\nresulting plethora of possible quantisations additional assumptions motivated\nby simplicity and plausibility are required. Multiplicative difference\noperators and the corresponding q-Borel kinematics are given on the circle and\nits N-point discretisation; the connection to q-deformations of the Witt\nalgebra is discussed. For a \"natural\" choice of the q-kinematics a\ncorresponding q-difference evolution equation is obtained. This study shows\ngeneral difficulties for a generalisation of a physical theory from a known one\nto a \"new\" framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Jul 2002 10:26:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2002 14:43:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
