To date, radio\nastronomers have located about 1,300 pulsars, and can estimate that there are\nabout 2 times 10^8 neutron stars in the galaxy. Many of these are surely old\nand cold enough that their interiors will contain matter in the superfluid or\nsuperconducting state. In fact, the so-called glitch phenomenon in pulsars (a\nsudden spin-up of the pulsar's crust) is best described by assuming the\npresence of superfluid neutrons and superconducting protons in the inner crusts\nand cores of the pulsars. Recently there has been much progress on modelling\nthe dynamics of superfluid neutron stars in both the Newtonian and general\nrelativistic regimes. We will discuss some of the main results of this recent\nwork, perhaps the most important being that superfluidity should affect the\ngravitational waves from neutron stars (emitted, for instance, during a glitch)\nby modifying both the rotational properties of the background star and the\nmodes of oscillation of the perturbed configuration. Finally, we present an\nanalysis of the so-called zero-frequency subspace (i.e. the space of\ntime-independent perturbations) and determine that it is spanned by two sets of\npolar (or spheroidal) and two sets of axial (or toroidal) degenerate\nperturbations for the general relativistic system. As in the Newtonian case,\nthe polar perturbations are the g-modes which are missing from the pulsation\nspectrum of a non-rotating configuration, and the axial perturbations should\nlead to two sets of r-modes when the degeneracy of the frequencies is broken by\nhaving the background rotate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 2002 01:33:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-19"}

Good correlation between simulated parameters of water and\nproteins spatial and dynamic ones points to crucial role of water in\nbiopolymers evolution. The possibilities of CAMP computer program has been\ndemonstrated in study of water perturbations under magnetic field treatment. A\nnew mechanisms of distant and local specific interaction between ligands and\nproteins are proposed. Computer simulations point, that coherent water clusters\ncould be in state of mesoscopic molecular Bose condensation (mBC) at\nphysiological temperatures. The coherent IR radiation of such kind of water\nclusters in microtubules (MTs) is responsible for exchange interaction between\nMTs of distant neurons, turning mBC to non-continuous macroscopic Bose\ncondensation. The wave function collapsing is accompanied by [gel-sol]\ntransitions in neurons bodies and their synaptic reorganization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 2002 08:28:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Jul 2002 09:41:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 23 Jan 2004 13:48:36 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 21 Jun 2007 13:03:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Non-triviality of such a proof\nsystem is based on the fact proved in this paper that the Graph\nNon-Automorphism problem, which is not known in BQP, can be reduced to our\ncomplete problem. Our results may be the first non-trivial quantum\nzero-knowledge proofs secure even against dishonest quantum verifiers, since\nour protocols are non-interactive, and thus the zero-knowledge property does\nnot depend on whether the verifier in the protocol is honest or not.

This semigroup describes the irreversible evolution of a\ndecaying 2-level atom. Using the integral-sum kernel approach to quantum\nstochastic calculus we couple the 2-level atom to an environment, which in our\ncase will be interpreted as the electromagnetic field. The irreversible time\nevolution of the 2-level atom then stems from the reversible time evolution of\natom and field together. Mathematically speaking, we have constructed a Markov\ndilation of the semigroup. The next step is to drive the atom by a laser and to\ncount the photons emitted into the field by the decaying 2-level atom. For\nevery possible sequence of photon counts we construct a map that gives the time\nevolution of the 2-level atom inferred by that sequence. The family of maps\nthat we obtain in this way forms a so-called Davies process.
