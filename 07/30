However, a neutral fraction (of\nhydrogen) as small as 0.1% is sufficient to cause the GP trough, hence its\ndetection alone cannot rule out reionization at a much earlier epoch. The\nCosmic Microwave Background (CMB) polarization anisotropy offers an alternative\nway to explore the dark age of the universe. We show that for most models\nconstrained by the current CMB data and by the discovery of a GP trough\n(showing that reionization occurred at z > 6.3), MAP can detect the\nreionization signature in the polarization power spectrum. The expected 1-sigma\nerror on the measurement of the electron optical depth is around 0.03 with a\nweak dependence on the value of that optical depth. Such a constraint on the\noptical depth will allow MAP to achieve a 1-sigma error on the amplitude of the\nprimordial power spectrum of 6%. MAP with two years (Planck with one year) of\nobservation can distinguish a model with 50% (6%) partial ionization between\nredshifts of 6.3 and 20 from a model in which hydrogen was completely neutral\nat redshifts greater than 6.3.

The simulations are global, where the self-gravity of the ISM,\nrealistic radiative cooling, and galactic rotation are taken into account. In\nthe analysis undertaken here, feedback processes from stellar energy source are\nomitted. We find that the velocity field of the disk in a non-linear phase\nshows a steady power-law energy spectrum over three-orders of magnitude in wave\nnumber. This implies that the random velocity field can be modeled as\nfully-developed, stationary turbulence. Gravitational and thermal instabilities\nunder the influence of galactic rotation contribute to form the turbulent\nvelocity field. The Toomre effective Q value, in the non-linear phase, ranges\nover a wide range, and gravitationally stable and unstable regions are\ndistributed patchily in the disk. These results suggest that large-scale\ngalactic rotation coupled with the self-gravity of the gas can be the ultimate\nenergy sources that maintain the turbulence in the local ISM.

The stability of this solution is anomalous,\nin that all freely impressible perturbations are stabilities, while unstable\nmodes request power proportional to their strength from the external agencies\nthat drive the flow, and so, in principle, are experimentally controllable.\nThis is very different from the behavior of the usual infinite fluid: The limit\nof infinite length is singular, and not that of the literature.

In the same model we demonstrate the virtues of a quasi-perturbative\nexpansion, obtained by resummation of the resurgent symbol in its\nnonperturbative direction, and which in contrast to the perturbative one is\nBorel summable.

We describe how qubits are realized\nand controlled with RF pulses, their internal interactions, and gradient\nfields. A peculiarity of NMR is that the internal interactions (given by the\ninternal Hamiltonian) are always on. We discuss how they can be effectively\nturned off with the help of a standard NMR method called ``refocusing''. Liquid\nstate NMR experiments are done at room temperature, leading to an extremely\nmixed (that is, nearly random) initial state. Despite this high degree of\nrandomness, it is possible to investigate QIP because the relaxation time (the\ntime scale over which useful signal from a computation is lost) is sufficiently\nlong. We explain how this feature leads to the crucial ability of simulating a\npure (non-random) state by using ``pseudopure'' states. We discuss how the\n``answer'' provided by a computation is obtained by measurement and how this\nmeasurement differs from the ideal, projective measurement of QIP. We then give\nimplementations of some simple quantum algorithms with a typical experimental\nresult. We conclude with a discussion of what we have learned from NMR QIP so\nfar and what the prospects for future NMR QIP experiments are.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jul 2002 06:33:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
