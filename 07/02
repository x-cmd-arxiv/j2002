In\nparticular, as the energy at which the GRB's $\\nu F_{\\nu}$ spectra is a maximum\n($E_{pk}$) decays through the four BATSE channels, the photon flux peak in each\nindividual channel will inevitably be offset producing what we measure as lag.\nWe test this hypothesis by measuring the rate of $E_{pk}$ decay ($\\Phi_{o}$)\nfor a sample of clean single peaked bursts with measured lag. We find a direct\ncorrelation between the decay timescale and the spectral lag, demonstrating the\nrelationship between time delay of the low energy photons and the decay of\n$E_{pk}$. This implies that the luminosity of a GRB is directly related to the\nburst's rate of spectral evolution, which we believe begins to reveal the\nunderlying physics behind the lag-luminosity correlation.

We rediscuss here several subtle issues\ninvolved in this work. So far only the scientific critique to this work was due\nto Tereno (astro-ph/9905144, astro-ph/9905298) and which was answered in Mitra\n(astro-ph/9905175, astro-ph/9905175, astro-ph/9905329). Now Tereno\n(gr-qc/0111073) has also admitted that the local 3-speed of a free particle as\nconventionally defined by all previous authors and as measured in any\ncoordinate system, is indeed c at the EH. Further since the acceleration SCALAR\nBLOWS UP at the EH, our result that there cannot be any EH at a finite R is\nreconfirmed. We explicitly show here that the final state of spherical collapse\nof very massive stars corresponds to a zero mass BH with 2M/R ->0. But at any\nfinite epoch there would be a Eternally Collapsing Objects (ECO) of finite\nmass. However, if quantum back reaction in the strong gravity regime would\ncause a phase transition p ~ rho, there could be static ultracompact objects\n(UCO) of ~ 10 M (solar). Further, if the phase transition goes proceeds to p=\n-rho, there could be UCOs of arbitrary high mass (Mazur & Mottola,\nastro-ph/0109035). Both ECOs and UCOs are expected to possess strong internal\nmagnetic field whereas the the same for a BH is zero. Robertson & Leiter (ApJ\n565, 447, 2002, astro-ph/0102381) have shown that the BH candiadates may indeed\npossess such strong intrinsic mag field. Thus the BHCs are likely to ECOs/UCOs\nrather than BHs.

The intracluster medium has a\nnon-monotonically decreasing radial abundance profile. We argue that the most\nplausible origin for the abundance enhancement is unmixed, high abundance\nsubcluster gas from the merger. The enrichment consists of two stages:\noff-center deposition of a higher abundance material during a subcluster merger\nfollowed by a strong, localized intracluster wind that acts to drive out the\nlight elements, producing the observed abundance enhancement. The wind is\nneeded to account for both an increase in the heavy element abundance and the\nlack of an enhancement in the gas density. Dynamical evidence for the wind\nincludes: (1) a large scale, low surface brightness feature perpendicular to\nthe merger axis that appears to be an asymmetric pattern of gas flow to the\nnorthwest, away from the center of the main cluster, (2) compressed gas in the\nopposite direction (toward the cluster center), and (3), the hottest regions\nvisible in the temperature map coincide with the proposed merger geometry and\nthe resultant gas flow.

For standard AGN jet outflow and environment parameters we show that\nthe initial beam distributions of interstellar protons and electrons quickly\nrelax to plateau-distributions in parallel momentum, transferring thereby\none-half of the initial energy density of the beam particles to electric field\nfluctuations of the generated electrostatic turbulence. On considerably longer\ntime scales, the plateaued interstellar electrons and protons will isotropise\nby their self-generated transverse turbulence and thus be picked-up in the\noutflow pair plasma.

Quite generally, the electron gas is unstable towards a\nsuperconducting state even in the absence of phonons.

In this situation, there are six competing instabilities:\n$s$- and d-wave superconductivity, spin-and charge-density waves and two phases\nwith circulating charge and spin currents, respectively. The required\nrenormalization group formalism is presented on a most elementary level,\nconnecting the idea of the ``parquet summation'' to the more modern concept of\nWilson's effective action. As a result, a rich phase diagram is obtained as a\nfunction of the model interaction.

The Statistically Preserved Structures are\neigenmodes of eigenvalue 1 of an appropriate propagator of the decaying\n(unforced) passive field, or equivalently, the zero modes of a related\noperator. In this paper we investigate further this surprising finding via two\nexamples, one akin to turbulent convection in which the temperature is the\nactive scalar, and the other akin to magneto-hydrodynamics in which the\nmagnetic field is the active vector. In the first example, all the even\ncorrelation functions of the active and passive fields exhibit identical\nscaling behavior. The second example appears at first sight to be a\ncounter-example: the statistical objects of the active and passive fields have\nentirely different scaling exponents. We demonstrate nevertheless that the\nStatistically Preserved Structures of the passive vector dominate again the\nstatistics of the active field, except that due to a dynamical conservation law\nthe amplitude of the leading zero mode cancels exactly. The active vector is\nthen dominated by the sub-leading zero mode of the passive vector. Our work\nthus suggests that the statistical properties of active fields in turbulence\ncan be understood with the same generality as those of passive fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2002 09:22:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
