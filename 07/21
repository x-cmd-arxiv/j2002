Abstracting from this particular objective, we propose L_{CIRC},\nwhich is an extension of generic propositional circumscription by allowing\npropositional combinations and nesting of circumscriptive theories. As shown,\nNATs are naturally embedded into this language, and are in fact of equal\nexpressive capability. We then analyze the complexity of L_{CIRC} and NATs, and\nin particular the effect of nesting. The latter is found to be a source of\ncomplexity, which climbs the Polynomial Hierarchy as the nesting depth\nincreases and reaches PSPACE-completeness in the general case. We also identify\nmeaningful syntactic fragments of NATs which have lower complexity. In\nparticular, we show that the generalization of Horn circumscription in the NAT\nframework remains CONP-complete, and that Horn NATs without fixed letters can\nbe efficiently transformed into an equivalent Horn CNF, which implies\npolynomial solvability of principal reasoning tasks. Finally, we also study\nextensions of NATs and briefly address the complexity in the first-order case.\nOur results give insight into the ``cost'' of using L_{CIRC} (resp.

In this case standard interval\nestimates are too pessimistic. We shall discuss a very strong form of the\neffect which appears in rational approximations to functions, where very\nsignificant errors in the approximant coefficients do not affect the accuracy\nof this approximant. The reason is that the errors in the coefficients of the\nrational approximant are not distributed in an arbitrary way, but form a\ncollection of coefficients for a new rational approximant to the same\napproximated function. Understanding this mechanism allows to decrease the\napproximation error by varying the approximation procedure depending on the\nform of the approximant. The effect of error autocorrection indicates that\nvariations of an approximated function under some deformations of rather\ngeneral type may have little effect on the corresponding rational approximant\nviewed as a function (whereas the coefficients of the approximant can have very\nsignificant changes). Accordingly, deforming a function for which good rational\napproximation is possible may lead to a rapid increase in the corresponding\napproximant's error. Thus the property of having a good rational approximation\nis not stable under small deformations of the approximated functions: this\nproperty is \"individual\", in the sense that it holds for specific functions.\nResults of computer experiments are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Jul 2002 10:25:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 17 Aug 2002 14:15:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
