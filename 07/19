Strong\nline emission from the ro-vibrational transitions of 12CO and 13CO is detected.\nIn total more than 40 distinct lines are seen in the covered region. The line\nemission is spatially extended and detected up to 2\" = 320 AU from the central\nsource but is spectrally unresolved (Delta v < 30 km/s). This is the first time\nstrong emission in the fundamental ro-vibrational band from CO has been\nobserved from an embedded young stellar object. The line fluxes were modeled\nusing a 1-dimensional full radiative transfer code, which shows that the\nemission is fully consistent with a gas in LTE at a single well constrained\ntemperature (T=515+/-5 K). Furthermore, the ratios between lines from the two\ndetected isotopic species of CO show that the 12CO lines must be optically\nthick. However, this is inconsistent with the observed spatial extent of the\nemission, since this implies such low CO column densities that the lines are\noptically thin. A likely solution to the discrepancy is that the lines are\nemitted by a smaller more dense region and then scattered in the bipolar cavity\npresent around the central star. This gives a rough estimate of the total\nmolecular gas mass of 1-100 M_earth and a physical extent of ~20-100 AU. We\npropose that the most likely origin of the line emission is post-shocked gas in\na dense dissociative accretion shock from the inner 10-50 AU of a circumstellar\ndisk. The presence of a shock capable of dissociating molecules in the disk\nwill have implications for the chemical evolution of disks around young low\nmass stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2002 16:28:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

This provides a very flexible and compact framework for\nknowledge representation and reasoning. Previous results show that nested logic\nprograms can be transformed into standard (unnested) disjunctive logic programs\nin an elementary way, applying the negation as failure operator to body\nliterals only. This is of great practical relevance since it allows us to\nevaluate nested logic programs by means of off-the-shelf disjunctive logic\nprogramming systems, like DLV.
