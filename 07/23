We examine the 2DFS of a pulsar signal\nsynthesized using the parameters of an empirical model for sub-pulse behaviour.\nWe show that the transform concentrates the modulation power to a relatively\nsmall area of phase space in the region corresponding to the characteristic\nfrequency of sub-pulses in longitude and pulse number. This property enables\nthe detection of the presence and parameters of drifting sub-pulses with great\nsensitivity even in data where the noise level far exceeds the instantaneous\nflux density of individual pulses. The amplitude of drifting sub-pulses is\nmodulated in time by scintillation and pulse nulling and in longitude by the\nrotating viewing geometry (with an envelope similar to that of the mean pulse\nprofile). In addition, sub-pulse phase as a function of longitude and pulse\nnumber can differ from that of a sinusoid due to variations in the drift rate\n(often associated with nulling) and through the varying rate of traverse of\nmagnetic azimuth afforded by the sight line.

This regime is very\ncommon in low-density hot astrophysical plasmas. During the early (kinematic)\nstage, weak magnetic fluctuations grow exponentially and concentrate at the\nresistive scale, which lies far below the hydrodynamic viscous scale. The\nevolution becomes nonlinear when the magnetic energy is comparable to the\nkinetic energy of the viscous-scale eddies. A physical picture of the ensuing\nnonlinear evolution of the MHD dynamo is proposed.

It is found that, while\nthe shift of the bulk of the magnetic energy from the subviscous scales to the\nvelocity scales may be possible, it occurs very slowly -- at the resistive,\nrather than dynamical, time scale (for galaxies, this means that generation of\nlarge-scale magnetic fields cannot be explained by this mechanism).

We present spectroscopic observations of nine\ngalaxies in the sample, which are used, in conjunction with updated stellar\npopulation models, to investigate star-formation histories. Environmental\neffects on early-type galaxy evolution are investigated by comparison with a\nsample of Fornax cluster E/S0s.

At a given\nluminosity, the E/S0 galaxies in low-density regions are younger than the E/S0s\nin clusters (by ~2-3 Gyr), and also more metal-rich (by ~0.2 dex).
