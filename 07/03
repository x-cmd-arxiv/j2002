In the present paper, a superconducting solution, based on the\nmagnon exchange mechanism, is obtained which closely matches the experiments\nwith $ZrZn_2$ and $URhGe$. The onset of superconductivity leads to the\nappearance of complicated Fermi surfaces in the spin up and spin down momentum\ndistribution functions.

The main reason for this\nproblem of establishing a link between agent logics and agent programming\nframeworks is identified and explained by the fact that agent programming\nframeworks have not incorporated the concept of a `declarative goal'. Instead,\nsuch frameworks have focused mainly on plans or `goals-to-do' instead of the\nend goals to be realised which are also called `goals-to-be'. In this paper, a\nnew programming language called GOAL is introduced which incorporates such\ndeclarative goals. The notion of a `commitment strategy' - one of the main\ntheoretical insights due to agent logics, which explains the relation between\nbeliefs and goals - is used to construct a computational semantics for GOAL.\nFinally, a proof theory for proving properties of GOAL agents is introduced.\nThus, we offer a complete theory of agent programming in the sense that our\ntheory provides both for a programming framework and a programming logic for\nsuch agents. An example program is proven correct by using this programming\nlogic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 2002 15:42:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The equations of motion in the bulk is solved using a low energy\nexpansion method. This allows us, through the junction conditions, to deduce\nthe effective equations of motion for the gravity on the brane. It is shown\nthat the gravity on the brane world is described by a quasi-scalar-tensor\ntheory with a specific coupling function omega(Psi) = 3 Psi / 2(1-Psi) on the\npositive tension brane and omega(Phi) = -3 Phi / 2(1+Phi) on the negative\ntension brane, where Psi and Phi are non-linear realizations of the radion on\nthe positive and negative tension branes, respectively. In contrast to the\nusual scalar-tensor gravity, the quasi-scalar-tensor gravity couples with two\nkinds of matter, namely, the matters on both positive and negative tension\nbranes, with different effective gravitational coupling constants. In\nparticular, the radion disguised as the scalar fields Psi and Phi couples with\nthe sum of the traces of the energy momentum tensor on both branes. In the\ncourse of the derivation, it has been revealed that the radion plays an\nessential role to convert the non-local Einstein gravity with the generalized\ndark radiation to the local quasi-scalar-tensor gravity. For completeness, we\nalso derive the effective action for our theory by substituting the bulk\nsolution into the original action.
