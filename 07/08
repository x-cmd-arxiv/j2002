This phenomenon happens when these stars reach the\nso-called Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB), which is a region of the\nHertzsprung-Russell diagram located at about the same region of effective\ntemperatures but at larger luminosities than those of regular giant stars. The\nperiod of these oscillations depends on the mass of the star. There is growing\nevidence that these oscillations are highly correlated with mass loss and that,\nas the mass loss increases, the pulsations become more chaotic. In this paper\nwe study a simple oscillator which accounts for the observed properties of this\nkind of stars.

We\nhave studied and characterized the dynamical behaviour of the oscillator as the\nparameters of the model are varied, leading us to explore a sequence of local\nand global bifurcations.

We analyze the dynamics\nfor different values of the time $\\tau$ during which the shaking is applied to\nthe system and for different intensities of the forces.

Such behavior smears out\nwhen a finite friction force is present. In this situation the dynamics is\nslower and lower asymptotic densities are attained. In particular, for\nsignificant friction forces, the final density decreases linearly with the\nfriction coefficient.
