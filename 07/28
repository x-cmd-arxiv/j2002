The NICMOS high\nangular resolution observations confirm the nature of a small scale jet arising\nfrom SVS 13, and resolve a structure in the HH 7 working surface that could\ncorrespond to Mach disk H2 emission.

If we\ninterpret the observed H2 flux density with molecular shock models of 20-30\nkm/s, then the jet has a density as high as 1.e+5 cc.

(E corresponds to the three-dimensional\nelectric field vector, B corresponds to the three-dimensional magnetic field\nvector and e_5 is the (grade-4) pseudoscalar.) In this paper it is proved that\nthe space-time split and the relative vectors are not relativistically correct,\nwhich means that the ordinary Maxwell equations with E and B and the field\nequations (FE) with F are not physically equivalent. Therefore we present the\nobserver independent decomposition of F by using the 1-vectors of electric E\nand magnetic B fields. The equivalent, invariant, formulations of relativistic\nelectrodynamics (independent of the reference frame and of the chosen\ncoordinatization for that frame) which use F, E and B, the real multivector Psi\n= E - e_5 cB and the complex 1-vector Psi = E - icB are developed and presented\nhere. The new observer independent FE are presented in formulations with E and\nB, with real and complex Psi. When the sources are absent the FE with real and\ncomplex Psi become Dirac like relativistic wave equations for the free photon.\nThe expressions for the observer independent stress-energy vector T(v)\n(1-vector), energy density U (scalar), the Poynting vector S and the momentum\ndensity g (1-vectors), the angular momentum density M (bivector) and the\nLorentz force K (1-vector) are directly derived from the FE. The local\nconservation laws are also directly derived from the FE and written in an\ninvariant way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Jul 2002 16:52:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2002 13:39:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Recently,\nnumerous schemes to achieve this task have been proposed. In order to generate\ntravelling-wave entangled coherent states, cross phase modulation, optimized by\noptical Kerr effect enhancement in a dense medium in an electromagnetically\ninduced transparency (EIT) regime, seems to be very promising. In this\nscenario, we propose a fully quantized model of a double-EIT scheme recently\nproposed [D. Petrosyan and G. Kurizki, {\\sl Phys. Rev. A} {\\bf 65}, 33833\n(2002)]: the quantization step is performed adopting a fully Hamiltonian\napproach. This allows us to write effective equations of motion for two\ninteracting quantum fields of light that show how the dynamics of one field\ndepends on the photon-number operator of the other. The preparation of a\nSchr\\\"odinger cat state, which is a superposition of two distinct coherent\nstates, is briefly exposed. This is based on non-linear interaction via\ndouble-EIT of two light fields (initially prepared in coherent states) and on a\ndetection step performed using a $50:50$ beam splitter and two photodetectors.\nIn order to show the entanglement of a generated entangled coherent state, we\nsuggest to measure the joint quadrature variance of the field. We show that the\nentangled coherent states satisfy the sufficient condition for entanglement\nbased on quadrature variance measurement. We also show how robust our scheme is\nagainst a low detection efficiency of homodyne detectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Jul 2002 12:47:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Oct 2002 11:17:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
