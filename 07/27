We present model calculations which show that the observed\nuniversality of abundances for 56 < Z < 75 elements in these stars does not\nimply a unique astrophysical site for the r-process. Neither does it imply a\nuniversality of abundances of nuclei outside of this range. In particular, we\nshow that a variety of astrophysical $r$-process models can be constructed\nwhich reproduce the same observed universal r-process curve for 56 < Z < 75\nnuclei, yet have vastly different abundances for Z >= 75 and possibly Z <= 56\nas well. This introduces an uncertainty into the use of the Th/Eu chronometer\nas a means to estimate the ages of the metal deficient stars. We do find,\nhowever, that the U/Th ratio is a robust chronometer. This is because the\ninitial production ratio of U to Th is almost independent of the astrophysical\nnucleosynthesis environment. The largest remaining uncertainties in the U/Th\ninitial production ratio are due to the input nuclear physics models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Jul 2002 00:41:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Jun 2003 23:03:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

All of the sources are found to lie in luminous\nelliptical galaxies, which follow the Kormendy relation for normal ellipticals.\nA very shallow trend is detected between nuclear brightness (corrected for\nbeaming) and host galaxy luminosity. Black hole masses are estimated for the\nentire sample, using both the bulge luminosity--black hole mass and the\nvelocity dispersion--black hole mass relations for local galaxies. The latter\ninvolves a new method, using the host galaxy morphological parameters, mu_e and\nr_e, to infer the velocity dispersion, sigma, via the fundamental plane\ncorrelation. Both methods indicate that the entire sample of radio-loud AGN are\npowered by very massive central black holes, with M_{black hole} ~ 10^8 to\n10^10 M_{sun}$. Eddington ratios range from L/L_{Eddington} ~ 2 x 10^-4 to ~1,\nwith the high- power sources having higher Eddington ratios than the low-power\nsources.

Counterexamples, for the\nhitherto open case of surfaces of general type, have been given in the last\nyears by Manetti, by Kharlamov-Kulikov and in my cited article. For the latter\nmuch simpler examples, it was shown that there are surfaces $S$ which are not\ndeformation equivalent to their complex conjugate. However, by Seiberg-Witten\ntheory, any (oriented) diffeomorphism of minimal surfaces carries the canonical\nclass K to + K or to - K, and deformation equivalence implies the existence of\na diffeomorphism carrying K to +K. In fact, as observed by a referee, the bulk\nof the proof was to show that our surfaces have no selfhomeomorphism carrying K\nto - K (the same for the K-K surfaces). In this note we show that Manetti's\nsurfaces provide indeed a counterexample to the reinforced conjecture, since\nthey are symplectomorphic. Our result is that a surface of general type has a\ncanonical symplectic structure (up to symplectomorphism) which is invariant for\ndeformation and for certain degenerations to normal surfaces. Since moreover no\nsimply connected counterexamples to the conjecture are known, we provide\nexplicit families of 1-connected surfaces, which are obtained by glueing\ntogether two fixed manifolds with boundary, are not deformation equivalent, but\nare homeomorphic under a homeomorphism carrying K to +K.

This suggests a close link between\nanisotropy and intermittency. However, a rigorous statistical description of\nanisotropic flows is, in most cases, hampered by the inhomogeneity of the\nfield. This difficulty is absent for the homogeneous shear flow. For this flow\nthe scale by scale budget is discussed here by using the appropriate form of\nthe Karman-Howarth equation, to determine the range of scales where the shear\nis dominant. The issuing generalization of the four-fifths law is then used as\nthe guideline to extend to shear dominated flows the Kolmogorov-Obhukhov theory\nof intermittency. The procedure leads naturally to the formulation of\ngeneralized structure functions and the description of intermittency thus\nobtained reduces to the K62 theory for vanishing shear. Also here the\nintermittency corrections to the scaling exponents are carried by the moments\nof the coarse grained energy dissipation field. Numerical experiments give\nindications that the dissipation field is statistically unaffected by the\nshear, thereby supporting the conjecture that the intermittency corrections are\nuniversal. This observation together with the present reformulation of the\ntheory gives reason for the increased intermittency observed in the classical\nlongitudinal velocity increments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jul 2002 17:52:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

What aspects of the study\nof entanglement are applicable to generalized coherent states? Conversely, what\ncan be learned about entanglement from the well-studied theory of coherent\nstates? With these questions in mind, we characterize unentangled pure states\nas extremal states when considered as linear functionals on the local Lie\nalgebra. As a result, a relativized notion of purity emerges, showing that\nthere is a close relationship between purity, coherence and (non-)entanglement.\nTo a large extent, these concepts can be defined and studied in the even more\ngeneral setting of convex cones of states. Based on the idea that entanglement\nis relative, we suggest considering these notions in the context of partially\nordered families of Lie algebras or convex cones, such as those that arise\nnaturally for multipartite systems. The study of entanglement includes notions\nof local operations and, for information-theoretic purposes, entanglement\nmeasures and ways of scaling systems to enable asymptotic developments. We\npropose ways in which these may be generalized to the Lie-algebraic setting,\nand to a lesser extent to the convex-cones setting.
