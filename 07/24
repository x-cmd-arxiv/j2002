This allows us to reconcile the apparently conflicting observations of a\nhigh X-ray emission measure and coronal density with a low rotational\nmodulation in X-rays. The technique is to extrapolate the coronal field from\nthe surface maps by assuming the field to be potential. We then determine the\ncoronal density for an isothermal corona by solving hydrostatic equilibrium\nalong each field line and scaling the plasma pressure at the loop footpoints\nwith the magnetic pressure. We set the density to zero along those field lines\nthat are open and those where at any point along their length the plasma\npressure exceeds the magnetic pressure. We then calculate the optically thin\nX-ray emission measure and rotational modulation for models with a range of\ncoronal densities. Although the corona can be very extended, much of the\nemission comes from high-latitude regions close to the stellar surface. Since\nthese are always in view as the star rotates, there is little rotational\nmodulation. We find that emission measures in the observed range of 10^52.8 -\n10^53.3 per cubic centimetre can be reproduced with densities in the range 10^9\n- 10^10.7 per cubic centimetre for coronae at temperatures of 10^6-10^7 K.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jul 2002 09:41:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The proton fraction is determined by the nuclear symmetry\nenergy whose density dependence may be constrained by measuring the neutron\nradius of a heavy nucleus, such as 208Pb. Such a measurement is necessary for a\nreliable extrapolation of the proton fraction to the higher densities present\nin the neutron star. A large neutron radius in 208Pb implies a stiff symmetry\nenergy that grows rapidly with density, thereby favoring a high proton fraction\nand allowing direct URCA cooling. Predictions for the neutron radius in 208Pb\nare correlated to the proton fraction in dense matter by using a variety of\nrelativistic effective field-theory models. Models that predict a neutron (Rn)\nminus proton (Rp) root-mean-square radius in 208Pb to be Rn-Rp<0.20 fm have\nproton fractions too small to allow the direct URCA cooling of 1.4 solar-mass\nneutron stars. Conversely, if Rn-Rp>0.25 fm, the direct URCA process is allowed\n(by all models) to cool down a 1.4 solar-mass neutron star. The Parity Radius\nExperiment at Jefferson Laboratory aims to measure the neutron radius in 208Pb\naccurately and model independently via parity-violating electron scattering.\nSuch a measurement would greatly enhance our ability to either confirm or\ndismiss the direct URCA cooling of neutron stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jul 2002 21:33:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The random walk is taking place in\nposition space and experimental implementation with present day technology\n--even using existing set-ups-- seems feasible. We analyze the influence of\npossible imperfections in the experiment and investigate the transition from a\nquantum random walk to the classical random walk for increasing errors and\ndecoherence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jul 2002 13:00:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-16"}
