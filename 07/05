We stress that we do not\nclaim to have a satisfactory answer to this question, rather our intention is\nto ignite a discussion by displaying the problems that have to be solved when\ncarrying out such a program. In the present paper we propose a scheme that one\nmight follow in order to arrive at such a limit. We discuss the technical and\nconceptual problems that arise in doing so and how they can be solved in\nprinciple. As to be expected, completely new issues arise due to the fact that\nQGR is a background independent theory. For instance, fundamentally the notion\nof a photon involves not only the Maxwell quantum field but also the metric\noperator - in a sense, there is no photon vacuum state but a \"photon vacuum\noperator\"! While in this first paper we focus on conceptual and abstract\naspects, for instance the definition of (fundamental) n-particle states (e.g.\nphotons), in the second paper we perform detailed calculations including, among\nother things, coherent state expectation values and propagation on random\nlattices. These calculations serve as an illustration of how far one can get\nwith present mathematical techniques. Although they result in detailed\npredictions for the size of first quantum corrections such as the gamma-ray\nburst effect, these predictions should not be taken too seriously because a)\nthe calculations are carried out at the kinematical level only and b) while we\ncan classify the amount of freedom in our constructions, the analysis of the\nphysical significance of possible choices has just begun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jul 2002 14:19:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The constructions\nof [1] make heavy use of the notion of semiclassical states for QGR. In the\npresent paper, we employ the complexifier coherent states for QGR recently\nproposed by Thiemann and Winkler as semiclassical states, and thus fill the\ngeneral formulas obtained in [1] with life. We demonstrate how one can, under\nsome simplifying assumptions, explicitely compute expectation values of the\noperators relevant for the gravity-matter Hamiltonians of [1] in the\ncomplexifier coherent states. These expectation values give rise to effective\nmatter Hamiltonians on the background on which the gravitational coherent state\nis peaked and thus induce approximate notions of n-particle states and matter\npropagation on fluctuating spacetimes. We display the details for the scalar\nand the electromagnetic field. The effective theories exhibit two types of\ncorrections as compared to the the ordinary QFT on CST. The first is due to the\nquantum fluctuations of the gravitational field, the second arises from the\nfact that background independence forces both geometry and matter to propagate\non a spacetime that is the product of the real line and a (random) graph.\nFinally we obtain explicit numerical predictions for non-standard dispersion\nrelations for the scalar and the electromagnetic field.
