Even when a semiclassical approximation for the propagator is\nvalid, the amplitude for any measurement includes an integral over the\ngravitational degrees of freedom.

The velocity fields responsible for advection are smooth\n(i.e., they have bounded gradients) and of a single large scale. Moreover, the\nscale of the velocity field is taken to be similar to the size of the entire\ndomain. The importance of the initial scale of variation of the scalar field\nwith respect to that of the velocity field is strongly emphasized. If these\nscales are comparable and the velocity field is time periodic, we see the\nformation of a periodic scalar eigenmode. The eigenmode is numerically realized\nby means of a deterministic 2D map on a lattice. Analytical justification for\nthe eigenmode is available from theorems in the dynamo literature. Weakening\nthe notion of an eigenmode to mean statistical stationarity, we provide\nnumerical evidence that the eigenmode solution also holds for aperiodic flows\n(represented by random maps). Turning to the evolution of an initially small\nscale scalar field, we demonstrate the transition from an evolving (i.e., {\\it\nnon} self similar) pdf to a stationary (self similar) pdf as the scale of\nvariation of the scalar field progresses from being small to being comparable\nto that of the velocity field (and of the domain). Furthermore, the {\\it non}\nself similar regime itself consists of two stages. Both the stages are examined\nand the coupling between diffusion and the distribution of the Finite Time\nLyapunov Exponents is shown to be responsible for the pdf evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jul 2002 18:34:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2002 20:11:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We measure the extent of SNP clustering as the\nratio between the variance of SNPs found in bins of length $l$, and the mean\nnumber of SNPs in such bins, $\\sigma^2_l/\\mu_l$. For a uniform SNP distribution\n$\\sigma^2_l/\\mu_l=1$, for clustered SNPs $\\sigma^2_l/\\mu_l > 1$.
