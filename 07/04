The source was detected at an unabsorbed\n0.5-10 keV flux of only (2.7 - 3.6) x 10^{-13} ergs/s/cm/cm, which implies a\n0.5-10 keV X-ray luminosity of approximately (3.2 - 4.3) x 10^{33} (d/10 kpc)^2\nerg/s, with d the distance to the source in kpc. Its spectrum had a thermal\nshape and could be well fitted by either a blackbody with a temperature kT of\n0.3 keV or a neutron star atmosphere model with a kT of ~0.1 keV. The\nluminosity and spectral shape of MXB 1659-29 are very similar to those observed\nof the other neutron star X-ray transients when they are in their quiescent\nstate. The source was variable during our observation, exhibiting a complete\neclipse of the inner part of the system by the companion star.

First, the results for Deeply Virtual Compton\nScattering (DVCS) at 4.2 GeV beam energy have recently been extracted from CLAS\ndata. The single spin asymmetry shows a remarkably clean sine wave despite the\nrather low Q2 achievable at this energy. Two new dedicated DVCS experiments\nusing 6 GeV beam will run in 2003 and 2004 in Hall A and Hall B respectively.\nBoth experiments will yield very accurate results over a wide range of\nkinematics, and allow for the first time a precise test of the factorization of\nthe DVCS process. Assuming the Bjorken regime is indeed reached, these\nexperiments will allow the extraction of linear combinations of GPD's and put\nstrong constraints on the available phenomenological models. Upon successful\ncompletion of both experiments, a wider experimental program at 6 GeV can be\nenvisioned, using for instance Deuterium targets trying to nail down the\nneutron and deuteron GPD's. In addition, resonances can be probed using\nDeltaVCS where one produces a resonance in the final state. Finally, the 12 GeV\nupgrade of Jefferson Lab extends the available kinematical range, and will\nallow us to perform a complete, high precision GPD program using various\nreactions among which, Deeply Virtual Meson Electroproduction (DVMP) and DVCS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 2002 18:32:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

The theory, which applies to both weak\nand strong atom-field coupling, is used to study the resonant energy exchange\nbetween two (two-level) atoms sharing initially a single excitation. In\nparticular, it is shown that in the regime of weak atom-field coupling there is\na time window, where the energy transfer follows a transfer-rate law of the\ntype obtained by ordinary second-order perturbation theory.

This complementarity has a form very similar to the complementarities\nusually encountered in quantum mechanics. For pure states, the entanglement\nplays the role of Planck's constant. We also find another class of\ncomplementarity relations which applies to operators, and is induced when two\nparties can only perform local operations and communicate classical.
