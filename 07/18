In this paper, we discuss how magnetic torquing may\nhelp explain disk formation with the observed quasi-Keplerian (as opposed to\nexpanding) velocity structure and their variability. We focus on the effects of\nthe rapid rotation of Be stars, considering the regime where centrifugal forces\nprovide the dominant radial support of the disk material. Using a kinematic\ndescription of the angular velocity, vphi(r), in the disk and a parametric\nmodel of an aligned field with a strength B(r) we develop analytic expressions\nfor the disk properties that allow us to estimate the stellar surface field\nstrength necessary to create such a disk for a range of stars on the\nmain-sequence. The model explains why disks are most common for main-sequence\nstars at about spectral class B2 V. The earlier type stars with very fast and\nhigh density winds would require unacceptably strong surface fields (> 10^3\nGauss) to form torqued disks, while the late B stars (with their low mass loss\nrates) tend to form disks that produce only small fluxes in the dominant Be\ndiagnostics. For stars at B2 V the average surface field required is about 300\nGauss. The predicted disks provide an intrinsic polarization and a flux at\nHalpha comparable to observations. We also discuss whether the effect on field\ncontainment of the time dependent accumulation of matter in the flux tubes/disk\ncan help explain some of the observed variability of Be star disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2002 15:12:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

In these\nexperiments, a femtosecond laser pump pulse excites electron-hole pairs via an\ninter-band transition in the material. These hot carriers rapidly release their\nenergy via electron-electron and electron-phonon collisions reaching states\nnear the Fermi energy within ~100 fs. If an energy gap is present in the\nlow-energy density of states (DOS), it inhibits the final relaxation step and\nphotoexcited carriers accumulate above the gap causing a transient change in\nreflectivity arising from excited state absorption. The relaxation and\nrecombination processes of photoexcited quasiparticles, governed by the\nmagnitude, anisotropy and the T-dependence of the low energy gap, are monitored\nby measuring the resulting photoinduced absorption as a function of time after\nthe photoexcitation. This way, the studies of carrier relaxation dynamics give\nus direct information of the T-dependent changes in the low energy DOS. The\ntechnique is particularly useful to probe the systems with spatial\ninhomogeneities, where different local environments give rise to different\nrelaxation rates. The data on series of HTSC-s show evidence for the\ncoexistence of two distinct relaxation processes, whose T-dependences seem to\nbe governed by two different energy scales: a T-independent pseudogap and a\nmean-field-like T-dependent gap that opens at Tc. The data suggest the origin\nof the two-gap behavior is in the intrinsic microscopic spatial inhomogeneity\nof these materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2002 23:35:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

Wireless networks are spatial\ngraphs that are usually much more clustered than random networks and have much\nhigher path length characteristics.

What is even more interesting is that such links need not\nbe formed randomly but may be confined to a limited number of hops between the\nconnected nodes. This has an important practical implication, as now we can\nintroduce a distributed algorithm in large-scale wireless networks, based on\nwhat we call contacts, to improve the performance of resource discovery in such\nnetworks, without resorting to global flooding. We propose new contact-based\nprotocols for adding logical short cuts in wireless networks efficiently. The\nnew protocols take advantage of mobility in order to increase reachability of\nthe search.
