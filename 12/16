Moderately weak impurities may get strong due\nto a renormalization by interacting electrons, so that transport is described\nin terms of theory for initially strong barriers. The renormalization of very\nweak impurities does not yield any peak in the transmission probability;\nhowever, remarkably, the interaction gives rise to a sharp peak in the\nconductance, provided asymmetry is not too high.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2002 06:05:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 May 2003 21:45:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The issue is viewed with respect\nto the necessary conditions for a long-term stable evolution of any natural and\nartificial system. It is shown that global coupling of the local fluctuations\nis necessary for providing a long-term stability of the system. A successful\ncoupling mechanism is achieved on the grounds of new assumptions about the\nHamiltonian response to certain perturbations. The coupling mechanism acts\ntowards a global synchronisation, i.e. to a coherent response of the excited\nspecies to any further perturbation. It is proven that the synchronisation is a\nscale-free process that has universal properties, e.g. it is insensitive to the\nchemical identity of the reacting species and to the particularities of the\nsurface reaction. Its hallmark is that the global adsorption rate exhibits\npermanent temporal variations whose amplitude is independent of the system\nsize.\n  The presence of these fluctuations fundamentally changes the temporal\nbehavior of the system, namely it becomes pulse-like both on the quantum and\nthe macro-level.

The system still possesses a parameter akin to a global\ntemperature, which is constant throughout the substance. There is also a useful\nquantity which acts like a {\\it local temperatures} and it varies throughout\nthe substance. These quantities are closely related to counterparts found in\ngeneral relativity. A lattice model with long-range spin-spin coupling is\nstudied. This is compared with systems such as those encountered in general\nrelativity, and gravitating systems with Newtonian-type interactions. A\nlong-range lattice model is presented which can be seen as a black-hole analog.\nOne finds that the analog's temperature and entropy have many properties which\nare found in black-holes. Finally, the entropy scaling behavior of a\ngravitating perfect fluid of constant density is calculated. For weak\ninteractions, the entropy scales like the volume of the system. As the\ninteractions become stronger, the entropy becomes higher near the surface of\nthe system, and becomes more area-scaling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2002 01:04:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 May 2003 20:03:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 21 Sep 2004 21:34:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
