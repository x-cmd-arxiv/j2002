We find that rings emitted in the equatorial plane can\nattain a stationary equilibrium state that is stable with respect to small\ndisplacements in radius, but is unstable when perturbed in the meridional\ndirection. Rings emitted at other latitudes travel toward the surface along\ntrajectories that largely parallel the rotation axis of the star. Over much of\nthe ascent, the instantaneous rise speed is determined by the rate of heating\nby the absorption of radiation that diffuses into the tube from the external\nmedium. Since the time scale for this heating varies like the square of the\ntube cross-sectional radius, for the same field strength, thin rings rise more\nrapidly than do thick rings.

This is due to the possible mixing between brane and bulk components of\nthe Higgs boson, that is, the non-trivial brane-bulk `location' of the lightest\nHiggs. To parametrize this mixing, we consider two Higgs doublets, one confined\nto the usual space dimensions and the other propagating in the bulk.\nCalculating the production and decay rates for the lightest Higgs boson, we\nfind that compared to the standard model (SM), the cross section receives a\nsuppression well below but an enhancement close to and above the\ncompactification scale M_c. This impacts the discovery of the lightest (SM\nlike) Higgs boson at colliders.

The first chapter is purely algebraic. The rest of\nthe book may be divided into three parts: general results on homotopy and\nsurgery (Chapters 2-6), geometries and geometric decompositions (Chapters\n7-13), and 2-knots (Chapters 14-18). In many cases the Euler characteristic,\nfundamental group and Stiefel-Whitney classes together form a complete system\nof invariants for the homotopy type of such manifolds, and the possible values\nof the invariants can be described explicitly.
