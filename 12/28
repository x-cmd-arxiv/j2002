This mechanism consists in\na certain instability that is akin to the well-known radial orbit instability;\nit is caused by the mutual attraction and alignment of axes of precessing star\norbits (up to now, such a way of formation was considered only for slow bars).\n  The general theory of the low-frequency modes of a disk consisting of\nprecessing orbits (at different angular velocities) is presented. The problem\nof determining these modes is reduced to the integral equations of a rather\nsimple structure. The characteristic pattern speeds ($\\Omega_p$) of the\nlow-frequency modes are of order of the mean orbit precession speeds\n($\\bar\\Omega_{pr}$). The bar-modes also belong to this type of modes. The slow\nbars have $\\Omega_p \\approx \\bar\\Omega_{pr}$; for the fast bars, $\\Omega_p$ may\nfar exceed even the maximum precessing speed of disk orbits (however,\n$\\Omega_p$ remains to be of order of these precessing speeds). The possibility\nof such an excess of $\\Omega_p$ over $\\Omega_{pr}^{\\max}$ is connected with the\neffect of ``repelling'' orbits that tend to move in the direction opposite to\nthat they are being pushed.\n  The preliminary analysis of the orbit precession patterns for a number of\ntypical potentials is given. It is noted that the maximum radius of the\n``attracting'' circular orbits ($r_c$) may be used as a reasonable estimate of\na bar length.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Dec 2002 22:56:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

One of the most important\ncoefficients is the relaxation time for the turbulent Maxwell stress, which\nuntil recently has been relatively ignored. We discuss this relaxation within\nthe context of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in steady high Reynolds-number,\nhigh magnetic-Reynolds-number shearing flows. The relaxation time for the\nturbulent Maxwell stress is not limited by the shear time scale, in contrast\nwith Reynolds-stress closure models for purely hydrodynamical turbulence. The\nanisotropy of the turbulent stress tensor for magnetohydrodynamic turbulence,\neven for the case of zero mean-field considered here, can therefore not be\nneglected.

The predictions for several flavor\nchanging neutral current rare radiative charm decays are given both in the\nStandard Model as well as for the MSSM with and without R parity conservation.\nFurther, the quenched version of HHChPT is used to estimate effects of quenched\napproximation in the lattice calculations of B-> pi, K transitions. In the\nthesis several technical details are clarified as well. The explicit\ncalculation of three and four-point scalar functions with one heavy-quark\npropagator is given. Also, existing renormalization group evolutions for B and\nK meson decays are modified to perform next-to-leading order evolution of\nWilson coefficients for charm decays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Dec 2002 17:20:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The main corrections are extended\nThomas-type corrections associated with the confining interactions in the\nbaryon. We investigate the contributions of low-lying angular excitations to\nthe moments quantitatively and show that they are completely negligible. When\nthe QCD corrections are combined with the non-quark model contributions of the\nmeson loops, we obtain a model which describes the moments within a mean\ndeviation of 0.04 $\\mu_N$. The nontrivial interplay of the two types of\ncorrections to the quark-model moments is analyzed in detail, and explains why\nthe quark model is so successful. In the course of these calculations, we\nparametrize the general spin structure of the $j={1/2}^+$ baryon wave functions\nin a form which clearly displays the symmetry properties and the internal\nangular momentum content of the wave functions, and allows us to use spin-trace\nmethods to calculate the many spin matrix elements which appear in the\nexpressions for the moments.
