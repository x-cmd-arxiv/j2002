The data is obtained by high-speed imaging and particle\ntracking techniques. We identify all particles in the system and link their\npositions to form trajectories over long times. Thus, we identify particle\ncollisions to measure the effective coefficient of restitution and find a broad\ndistribution of values for the same impact angles. We find that the energy\ninelasticity can take on values greater than one, which implies that the\nrotational degrees play an important role in energy transfer. We also measure\nthe distance and the time between collision events in order to directly\ndetermine the distribution of path lengths and the free times. These\ndistributions are shown to deviate from expected theoretical forms for elastic\nspheres, demonstrating the inherent clustering in this system. We describe the\ndata with a two-parameter fitting function and use it to calculated the mean\nfree path and collision time. We find that the ratio of these values is\nconsistent with the average velocity. The velocity distribution are observed to\nbe strongly non-Gaussian and do not demonstrate any apparent universal\nbehavior. We report the scaling of the second moment, which corresponds to the\ngranular temperature, and higher order moments as a function of distance from\nthe driving wall. Additionally, we measure long time correlation functions in\nboth space and in the velocities to probe diffusion in a dissipative gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Dec 2002 23:49:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

This discrete structure takes\nthe form of a locally finite order relation, where the order, corresponding\nwith the macroscopic notion of spacetime causality, is taken to be a\nfundamental aspect of nature.\n  After an introduction to the Causal Set approach, this thesis considers a\nsimple toy dynamics for causal sets. Numerical simulations of the model provide\nevidence for the existence of a continuum limit. While studying this toy\ndynamics, a picture arises of how the dynamics can be generalized in such a way\nthat the theory could hope to produce more physically realistic causal sets. By\nthinking in terms of a stochastic growth process, and positing some fundamental\nprinciples, we are led almost uniquely to a family of dynamical laws\n(stochastic processes) parameterized by a countable sequence of coupling\nconstants. This result is quite promising in that we now know how to speak of\ndynamics for a theory with discrete time. In addition, these dynamics can be\nexpressed in terms of state models of Ising spins living on the relations of\nthe causal set, which indicates how non-gravitational matter may arise from the\ntheory without having to be built in at the fundamental level.\n  These results are encouraging in that there exists a natural way to transform\nthis classical theory, which is expressed in terms of a probability measure, to\na quantum theory, expressed in terms of a quantum measure. A sketch as to how\none might proceed in doing this is provided. Thus there is good reason to\nexpect that Causal Sets are close to providing a background independent theory\nof quantum gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Dec 2002 02:29:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

By controlling the splitting and fusing of potential\nwells, we show how to interconvert Mott-insulator-like and trapped BEC-like\nstates. We also discuss the generation of \"Schr\\\"odinger cat\" states by\nsplitting a microtrap and taking into practical consideration the asymmetry\nbetween the resulting wells. These schemes can be used to perform multiparticle\ninterferometry with neutral atoms, where interference effects can be observed\nonly when all the participating particles are measured.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Dec 2002 19:51:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Apr 2003 22:50:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
