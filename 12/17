We calculate predicted\nHODs for a Lambda-CDM cosmological model using an SPH hydrodynamic simulation\nand a semi-analytic (SA) galaxy formation model. Although the two methods\npredict different galaxy mass functions, their HOD predictions agree remarkably\nwell.

At low <N>, the mean pair and triple\ncounts are well below Poisson expectations, with important consequences for\nsmall scale behavior of 2- and 3-point correlation functions. The HOD depends\nstrongly on galaxy age, with high mass halos populated mainly by old galaxies\nand low mass halos by young galaxies. The SPH simulation supports several\nsimplifying assumptions about HOD bias: the most massive galaxy in a halo\nusually lies close to the center and moves near the halo's mean velocity;\nsatellite galaxies have the same radial profile and velocity dispersion as the\ndark matter; and the mean occupation at fixed halo mass is independent of the\nhalo's larger scale environment.

To derive the governing equations for the following car dynamics a\ncost functional that ranks the outcomes of different driving strategies is\nconstructed, which applies to fairly general properties of the driver behavior.\nAssuming the driver behavior to be rational, the existence of the Nash\nequilibrium is proved. Rational driving is defined by supposing that a driver\ncorrects continuously the car motion to follow the optimal path minimizing the\ncost functional. The corresponding car-following dynamics is described quite\ngenerally by a boundary value problem based on the obtained extremal equations.\nLinearization of these equations around the stationary state results in a\ngeneralization of the widely used optimal velocity model. Moreover, it is shown\nthat there are conditions (the ``dense traffic'' limit) under which the\nrational car dynamics comprises two stages, fast and slow. During the fast\nstage a driver eliminates the velocity difference between the cars, the\nsubsequent slow stage optimizes the headway. In the ``dense traffic'' limit an\neffective Hamiltonian description is constructed. This allows a more detailed\nnonlinear analysis. Finally, the differences between rational and bounded\nrational driver behavior are discussed. The latter, in particular, justifies\nsome basic assumptions used recently by the authors to construct a\ncar-following model lying beyond the frameworks of rationality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2002 22:06:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Apr 2003 08:07:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

For bipartite mixed\nstates and multipartite pure states it is likely that a more powerful class of\noperations will be needed. To this end \\cite{BPRST01} have defined more\npowerful versions of state transformations (or reducibilities), namely LOCCq\n(asymptotic LOCC with a sublinear amount of quantum communication) and CLOCC\n(asymptotic LOCC with catalysis). In this paper we show that {\\em LOCCq state\ntransformations are only as powerful as asymptotic LOCC state transformations}\nfor multipartite pure states. We first generalize the concept of entanglement\ngambling from two parties to multiple parties: any pure multipartite entangled\nstate can be transformed to an EPR pair shared by some pair of parties and that\nany irreducible $m$ $(m\\ge 2)$ party pure state can be used to create any other\nstate (pure or mixed), using only local operations and classical communication\n(LOCC).
