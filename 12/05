The\nparticles emitted by a source located in the disk do not pervade the whole\nGalaxy, but are rather confined to a smaller region whose spatial extension is\nrelated to the height of the diffusive halo, the Galactic wind and the\nspallation rate. Following the pioneering work of Jones (1978), this paper\npresents a general study on the spatial origin of cosmic rays, with a\nparticular attention to the role of spallations and Galactic wind.

A particular simple model with a N = 1 SUSY spectrum\nand three quark-lepton generations is studied in some detail. Remarkably, one\ncan reproduce the observed spectrum of quark masses and mixings for particular\nchoices of the compact radii and brane locations. In order to reproduce the\nsmallness of up- and down-quark masses branes should be located in simple\ngeometric configurations leading to some accidental global symmetries.

In particular, there are U(1)_Y strings that arise due to K^0\ncondensation that occurs when the strange quark mass is relatively large. The\nunique feature of these strings is that they possess a nonzero K^+ condensate\nthat is trapped on the core. In the following we will show that these strings\n(with nontrivial core structure) can form closed loops with conserved charge\nand currents trapped on the string worldsheet. The presence of conserved\ncharges allows these topological defects, called vortons, to carry angular\nmomentum, which makes them classically stable objects. We also give arguments\ndemonstrating that vortons carry angular momentum very efficiently (in terms of\nenergy per unit angular momentum) such that they might be the important degrees\nof freedom in the cores of neutron stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2002 23:45:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Oct 2003 20:39:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

It is shown that the velocity\nrepresentation of the Clebsch type introduced by means of the variational\nprinciple with constraints is equivalent to the representation following from\nthe generalization of the Weber transformation for the case of arbitrary MHD\nflows. The integrals of motion and local invariants for MHD are under\nexamination. It is proved that there exists generalization of the Ertel\ninvariant. It is expressed in terms of generalized vorticity field (discussed\nearlier by Vladimirov and Moffatt (V. A. Vladimirov, H. K. Moffatt, J. Fl.\nMech., vol. 283, pp.~125--139, 1995) for the incompressible case). The\ngeneralized vorticity presents the frozen-in field for the barotropic and\nisentropic flows and therefore for these flows there exists generalized\nhelicity invariant. This result generalizes one obtained by Vladimirov and\nMoffatt in the cited work for the incompressible fluid. It is shown that to\neach invariant of the conventional hydrodynamics corresponds MHD invariant and\ntherefore our approach allows correct limit transition to the conventional\nhydrodynamic case. The additional advantage of the approach proposed enables\none to deal with discontinuous flows, including all types of possible breaks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2002 15:34:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
