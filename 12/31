We find analytical, fully cosmological similarity solutions taking\naccount of the collisional interaction of SIDM particles. This interaction\nresults in a thermal conductivity that heats the halo core and flattens its\ndensity profile. These similarity solutions are relevant to galactic and\ncluster halo formation in the CDM model. We assume an initial mass profile dM/M\nM^{-eps}, as in the familiar secondary infall model. If eps=1/6, SIDM halos\nwill evolve self-similarly, with a cold, supersonic infall terminated by a\nstrong accretion shock. Different solutions arise for different values of the\ncollisionality parameter, Q= sigma rho_b r_s, where sigma is the scattering\ncross section, rho_b is the cosmic mean density, and r_s is the shock radius.\nFor all these solutions, a flat-density, isothermal core is present which grows\nin size as a fixed fraction of r_s. We find two different regimes for these\nsolutions: 1) for Q \\leq Q_{th}, the core density decreases and core size\nincreases as Q increases; 2) for Q \\geq Q_{th}, the core density increases and\ncore size decreases as Q increases.

A real del Pezzo surface is the invariant set under\nan antilinear involution of a complex one.
