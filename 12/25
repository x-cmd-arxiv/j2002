This model\nallows us to derive the star formation rate, optical depth by dust and apparent\neffective radius of starburst regions at various wavelengths; as a result, the\nintrinsic surface brightness of starburst regions can be derived. Using this\nSED model, we analyse 16 UV-selected starburst galaxies and 10 ultraluminous\ninfrared galaxies. The derived star formation rates and optical depths are\ncompared with emission line measurements and found to be consistent. The\nderived apparent effective radii are also consistent with observations. From\nthe SED analysis, we find a bimodal property of the star formation rate with\nthe optical depth and the compactness of stellar distributions. While mild\nstarbursts have a limiting intrinsic surface brightness L(bol) x r_e^{-2} ~\n10^{12} Lsun kpc^{-2}, intense starbursts tend to be more heavily obscured and\nconcentrated within a characteristic scale of r_e ~ 0.3 kpc. We suggest that\nthe mild starbursts can be triggered by a self-gravitating disc instability in\nwhich feedback is effective in the shallow gravitational potential. On the\nother hand, the intense starbursts can be induced via an external dynamical\nperturbation like galaxy merging, in which feedback is less effective due to\nthe deep gravitational potential attained by the large gas concentration within\nthe central starburst region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Dec 2002 16:35:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2003 19:06:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
