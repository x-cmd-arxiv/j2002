The gravitational waves (GWs) can either be emitted\nvia the excitation of r-modes or from a deformed crust. GW emission can thus\nintervene to slow-down or halt the otherwise relentless spin-up from accretion.\nPrior to this theoretical work (and the measurements of NS rotation rates in\nLMXBs) the community was rather confident that an accreting NS would be spun-up\nto rotation rates near breakup, motivating searches for sub-millisecond\nobjects. After only briefly describing the physics of the GW processes, I argue\nthat the limiting spin frequency might be appreciably lower than the breakup\nfrequency. Millisecond radio pulsar observers would likely discover the impact\nof GW emission as a dropoff in the number of pulsars beyond 600 Hz, and I show\nhere that the millisecond pulsar inventory in 47 Tuc might already exhibit such\na cutoff.

The most frightening scenario is the one involving the\ndetonation of a nuclear device at the heart of a large metropolitan city.\nUnless the terrorists are in possession of a fully assembled modern nuclear\nweapons it is very likely that they will possess a crude nuclear device which\nhas been assembled in a terrorist camp by people with relatively limited\ntechnological resources. It well known that the Oppenheimer team, which\ndesigned and tested the first nuclear weapon (the gadget), had a lot of\nreservations as to whether the first test at Alamogordo would produce any yield\nat all. Therefore, the most likely scenario is that the terrorists will achieve\neither a nominal yield or no yield at all (Fizzle). In this study we will\ninvestigate all those parameters that play a decisive role in the number of\ncasualties after such an attack so that we can propose effective means of\navoiding mass destruction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Nov 2002 20:15:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Mar 2003 19:15:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 16 Feb 2014 15:19:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-18"}

Together they endow the quantum\nHilbert space with the structure of a K\\\"{a}ller manifold. Quantum control is\ndiscussed in this setting. Quantum time-evolution corresponds to smooth\nHamiltonian dynamics and measurements to jumps in the phase space. This adds\nadditional power to quantum control, non unitarily controllable systems\nbecoming controllable by ``measurement plus evolution''. A picture of quantum\nevolution as Hamiltonian dynamics in a classical-like phase-space is the\nappropriate setting to carry over techniques from classical to quantum control.\nThis is illustrated by a discussion of optimal control and sliding mode\ntechniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Dec 2002 12:53:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
