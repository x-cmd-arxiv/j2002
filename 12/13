A case of fast outflow (up to ~1000\nkm/s) is also observed in HI in the radio source 4C12.50. As the radio source\nevolves, any obscuring material along the radio axis is swept aside until,\neventually, cavities (of the same kind as observed e.g. in Cygnus A) are\nhollowed out on either side of the nucleus.

We also detect HI absorption against the\ncentral radio continuum component. The detection of the HI, its structure and\nkinematics, give us key information for building a possible evolutionary\nscenario. The characteristics of the detected HI are explained as the result of\na major merger event that is likely to have occurred <10^9 yr ago.\nInterestinly, we find that, when observed in radio continuum at higher\nresolution, this galaxy has a double lobed, steep spectrum structure of about 1\nkpc in size.

B2~0648+27 is one\nof the few nearby radio galaxies where extended neutral hydrogen has been\ndetected so far.

As a test, we reproduce the Poisson-Boltzmann surface potential for\na single charge planar surface both in the weak-charge and strong-charge\nregime. We then apply our techniques to non-planar geometries where closed-form\nsolutions of the non-linear Poisson-Boltzmann equation are not available. In\nthe cylindrical case, the Manning charge renormalization result is obtained in\nthe limit of vanishing salt concentration. However, for intermediate salt\nconcentrations a slow crossover to the non-charge-renormalized regime (at high\nsalt) is found with a quasi-power-law behavior which helps to understand\nconflicting experimental and theoretical results for the electrostatic\npersistence length of polyelectrolytes. In the spherical geometry charge\nrenormalization is only found at intermediate salt concentrations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Dec 2002 11:44:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The use of the light, stable and inert He atom not only opens the\nunique possibility of measuring quantum reflectivity in the thusfar\ninaccessible limit of high energies, but also allows the determination of the\ngas-solid interaction potential. The specularly reflected intensity from the\nrough surface shows a change of 5 orders of magnitude within an incident\nangular range of less than 6 degrees. By separating out the influence of\nsurface disorder the quantum reflection coefficient for the smooth surface is\ndeduced. Firstly, the data confirm the high energy asymptotic behavior of the\nreflection, defined by the non-retarded attractive van der Waals potential. The\nexperiment shows very good agreement with our calculations covering the entire\nenergy region, in which also Casimir forces play a role. Parameters for the\ngas-solid interaction perfectly match those reported in literature in the\nvicinity of the potential minimum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Dec 2002 17:25:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

If space is a physical entity through which quantum information (QI)\nmust be transported, then one can define its speed. If not, QI exists apart\nfrom space, making space in some sense `nonphysical'. But we can still assign a\n`speed' of QI to such models based on their properties. In both cases,\nclassical information must still travel at $c$, though in the latter case the\norigin of local spacetime itself is a puzzle. We consider the properties of\ndifferent regimes for this speed of QI, and relevant quantum interpretations.\nFor example, we show that the Many Worlds Interpretation (MWI) is nonlocal\nbecause it is what we call `spatially complete'.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Dec 2002 18:15:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
