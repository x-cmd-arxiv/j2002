The mapped region is 14'x2.5' in size (2pc x\n0.3pc) and consists of at least four dense cores which are likely to be\nprestellar in nature. To study the dust properties of the ridge and its\nembedded cores, we combined the dust emission data with dust extinction data\nobtained by Lada et al.

The\ncores themselves are almost isothermal. We used the extinction data to derive\nin addition a map of the dust emissivity. Its average value agrees well with\nthe canonical value of Mathis (1990). We find that the dust emissivity\nparametrized by kappa_850/kappa_V increases by a factor of about 4 when the\ndust temperature decreases from ~20K to ~12K.

We analytically estimate\nthe noise expected in the reconstructed gravitational field, taking into\naccount the uncertainties associated with a finite survey, photometric redshift\nuncertainty, redshift-space distortions, and multiple scattering events. In\norder to implement this approach for future data analysis, we simulate the\nlensing distortion fields due to various mass distributions. We create\ncatalogues of galaxies sampling this distortion in three dimensions, with\nrealistic spatial distribution and intrinsic ellipticity for both ground-based\nand space-based surveys. Using the resulting catalogues of galaxy position and\nshear, we demonstrate that it is possible to reconstruct the lensing and\ngravitational potentials with our method. For example, we demonstrate that a\ntypical ground-based shear survey with redshift limit z=1 and photometric\nredshifts with error Delta z=0.05 is directly able to measure the 3-D\ngravitational potential for mass concentrations >10^14 M_\\odot between\n0.1<z<0.5, and can statistically measure the potential at much lower mass\nlimits. The intrinsic ellipticity of objects is found to be a serious source of\nnoise for the gravitational potential, which can be overcome by Wiener\nfiltering or examining the potential statistically over many fields.

Comparison of the CO line intensities with a large velocity\ngradient, escape probability model indicates that the bulk of the 2-5 x 10^7\nsolar masses of molecular gas in the central 180 pc is highly excited. A model\nwith T ~ 120 K, n_H_2 ~ 4.5 x 10^4 cm^-3 is consistent with the observed CO\nintensities as well as the rotational H2 lines observed with ISO.\n  The inferred mass of warm, dense molecular gas is 10--30 times the atomic gas\nmass as traced through its [CII] and [OI] line emission.

First,\nthere is the old cosmological constant problem, with a new twist: the\ncoincidence problem. Secondly, cosmology still lacks a model to predict the\nobserved current cosmic acceleration and to determine whether or not there is a\nfuture exit out of this state (as previously in the inflationary case). This\nconstitutes (what is called here) a dynamical problem. In this article a\nframework is proposed to address these two problems, based on treating the\ncosmic background vacuum (dark) energy as both dynamical and interacting. The\nuniverse behaves as a vacuum-driven cosmic engine which, in search of\nequilibrium, always back-reacts to vacuum-induced accelerations by increasing\nits inertia (internal energy) through vacuum energy dissipation. The process\ncouples cosmic vacuum (dark) energy to matter to produce future-directed\nincreasingly comparable amplitudes in these fields by setting up oscillations\nin the decaying vacuum energy density and corresponding sympathetic ones in the\nmatter fields. By putting bounds on the relative magnitudes of these coupled\noscillations the model offers a natural and conceptually simple channel to\ndiscuss the coincidence problem, while also suggesting a way to deal with the\ndynamical problem. A result with useful observational implications is an\nequation of state w(t) which specifically predicts a variable, quasi-periodic,\nacceleration for the current universe.

The full\nstory is more complicated and more interesting. The Baldwin effect is concerned\nwith the costs and benefits of lifetime learning by individuals in an evolving\npopulation. Several researchers have focussed exclusively on the benefits, but\nthere is much to be gained from attention to the costs.

Our main result\nis a universal expression for the difference of the scale anomalies between the\nultraviolet and infrared fixed points, which is of order 1 in the large N\nexpansion. Our computations are entirely field theoretic, and the results are\nshown to agree with predictions from AdS/CFT. We also remark that a certain\ntwo-point function can be computed for all energy scales on both sides of the\nduality, with full agreement between the two and no scheme dependence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Dec 2002 03:00:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2002 22:39:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-05"}
