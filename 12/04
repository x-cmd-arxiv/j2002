Here, we study the applicability of the SFM to HST images of galaxies in\nthe Local Group, and show that background galaxies cannot be easily identified\nthrough these nearby objects, even with the best resolution available today. In\nthe case of M 31, each pixel in the HST images contains 50 to 100 stars, and\nthe background galaxies cannot be seen because of the intrinsic granularity due\nto strong surface brightness fluctuations. In the LMC, on the other hand, there\nis only about one star every six linear pixels, and the lack of detectable\nbackground galaxies results from a ``secondary'' granularity, introduced by\nstructure in the wings of the point spread function. The success of the SFM in\nNGC 4536 and NGC 3664 is a natural consequence of the reduction of the\nintensity of surface brightness fluctuations with distance. When the dominant\nconfusion factor is structure in the PSF wings, as is the case of HST images of\nthe LMC, and would happen in M 31 images obtained with a 10-m diffraction-\nlimited optical telescope, it becomes in principle possible to improve the\ndetectability of background galaxies by subtracting the stars in the foreground\nobject.

The reverse process, called oxidation, is the\nreconstruction of the possible higher dimensional theories, given the lower\ndimensional theory. In 3 dimensions, all degrees of freedom can be dualized to\nscalars. Given the group G for a 3 dimensional sigma model on the coset G/H, we\ndemonstrate an efficient method for recovering the higher dimensional theories,\nessentially by decomposition into subgroups. The equations of motion, Bianchi\nidentities, Kaluza-Klein modifications and Chern-Simons terms are easily\nextracted from the root lattice of the group G. We briefly discuss some aspects\nof oxidation from the E_{8(8)}/SO(16) coset, and demonstrate that our formalism\nreproduces the Chern-Simons term of 11-d supergravity, knows about the\nT-duality of IIA and IIB theory, and easily deals with self-dual tensors, like\nthe 5-tensor of IIB supergravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2002 14:14:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We\nconsider atoms in a three or four-level Lambda-configuration coupled to a\nhigh-finesse optical cavity which is driven by a squeezed light field. Raman\ntransitions are induced between a pair of stable atomic ground states via the\nsqueezed cavity mode and coherent driving fields. An analysis of the reduced\nmaster equation for the atomic ground states shows that a three-level atomic\nsystem has insufficient parameter flexibility to act as an effective two-level\natom interacting exclusively with a squeezed reservoir. However, the inclusion\nof a fourth atomic level, coupled dispersively to one of the two ground states\nby an auxiliary laser field, introduces an extra degree of freedom and enables\nthe desired interaction to be realised. As a means of detecting the reduced\nquadrature decay rate of the effective two-level system, we examine the\ntransmission spectrum of a weak coherent probe field incident upon the cavity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2002 01:26:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
