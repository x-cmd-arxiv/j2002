Dwarf galaxies, as\nthe putative building blocks of hierarchical galaxy formation, and also as the\nmost numerous galaxies in the Universe, play a central role in cosmic\nevolution. In particular, the interplay of galactic and intergalactic material\naround dwarf irregulars must be more extensive than in more massive disk\ngalaxies because of their lower gravitational potential and lower interstellar\npressures. The outer regions of dwarf irregular galaxies therefore yield vital\nclues to the dominant processes in this interaction zone.\n  The Workshop addressed a number of questions related to the role of the outer\nregions in the evolution of dwarf galaxies and broader consequences.

A set of data is typically consistent with an infinite\nnumber of hypotheses; therefore, there must be factors other than the data that\ndetermine the output of the learning algorithm. In machine learning, these\nother factors are called the bias of the learner. Classical learning algorithms\nhave a fixed bias, implicit in their design. Recently developed learning\nalgorithms dynamically adjust their bias as they search for a hypothesis.\nAlgorithms that shift bias in this manner are not as well understood as\nclassical algorithms. In this paper, we show that the Baldwin effect has\nimplications for the design and analysis of bias shifting algorithms. The\nBaldwin effect was proposed in 1896, to explain how phenomena that might appear\nto require Lamarckian evolution (inheritance of acquired characteristics) can\narise from purely Darwinian evolution.

The simplicity of the model\nmakes planning computationally inexpensive. It is shown that pRL finds an\noptimal policy, and that plannable macro actions found by pRL are near-optimal.\nIn turn, it is unnecessary to try large numbers of macro actions, which enables\nfast learning.

Gauge coupling\nunification, the quantum numbers of quarks and leptons and the longevity of the\nproton arise as phenomena of the symmetrical bulk, while the lightness of the\nHiggs doublets and the masses of the light quarks and leptons probe the\nsymmetry breaking defect. Moreover, the framework is extremely predictive if\nthe effective higher dimensional theory is valid over a large energy interval\nup to the scale of strong coupling. Precise agreement with experiments is\nobtained in the simplest theory --- SU(5) in five dimensions with two Higgs\nmultiplets propagating in the bulk. The weak mixing angle is predicted to be\nsin^2theta_w = 0.2313 \\pm 0.0004, which fits the data with extraordinary\naccuracy. The compactification scale and the strong coupling scale are\ndetermined to be M_c \\simeq 5 x 10^{14} GeV and M_s \\simeq 1 x 10^{17} GeV,\nrespectively. Proton decay with a lifetime of order 10^{34} years is expected\nwith a variety of final states such as e^+pi^0, and several aspects of flavor,\nincluding large neutrino mixing angles, are understood by the geometrical\nlocations of the matter fields. When combined with a particular supersymmetry\nbreaking mechanism, the theory predicts large lepton flavor violating mu -> e\nand tau -> mu transitions, with all superpartner masses determined by only two\nfree parameters. The predicted value of the bottom quark mass from Yukawa\nunification agrees well with the data. This paper is mainly a review of the\nwork presented in hep-ph/0103125, hep-ph/0111068 and hep-ph/0205067.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2002 20:58:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}

This analysis helps better\nunderstand the role and place of string theory in the modern picture of the\nphysical world. Even though quantum field theory describes a wide range of\nexperimental phenomena, it is emphasized that there are some insurmountable\nproblems inherent in it - notably the impossibility to formulate the quantum\ntheory of gravity on its basis - which prevent it from being a fundamental\nphysical theory of the world of microscopic distances. It is this task, the\ncreation of such a theory, which string theory, currently far from completion,\nis expected to solve. In spite of its somewhat vague current form, string\ntheory has already led to a number of serious results and greatly contributed\nto progress in the understanding of quantum field theory.

This vector has been associated with the names of Laplace, Runge,\nand Lenz, among others. Many workers have explored aspects of the symmetry and\ndegeneracy associated with this vector and with analogous dynamical symmetris.\nWe define a conserved dynamical variable $\\alpha$ that characterizes the\norientation of the orbit in two-dimensional configuration space for the Kepler\nproblem and an analogous variable $\\beta$ for the isotropic harmonics\noscillator. This orbit orientation variable is canonically conjugate to the\nangular momentum component normal to the plane of motion. We explore the\ncanoncial one-parameter group of transformations generated by $\\alpha (\\beta).$\nBecause we have an obvious pair of conserved canonically conjugate variables,\nit is desirable to us them as a coordinate-momentum pair. In terms of these\nphase space coordinates, the form of the Hamiltonian is nearly trivial because\nneither member of the pair can occur explicitly in the Hamiltonian. From these\nconsiderations we gain a simple picture of the dynamics in phase space. The\nprocedure we use is in the spirit of the Hamilton-Jacobi method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2002 22:18:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
