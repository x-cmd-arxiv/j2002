A radiation fluid is coupled to the field\nequations, which appears as a consequence of the Maxwellian terms in the\nRamond-Ramond sector. Singularity free bouncing solutions in which the dilaton\nis finite and strictly positive are obtained for models with flat or negative\ncurvature spatial sections when the dilatonic coupling constant is such that\n$\\omega < - 3/2$, which may appear in the so called $F$ theory in 12\ndimensions. These bouncing phases are smoothly connected to the radiation\ndominated expansion phase of the standard cosmological model, and the\nasymptotic pasts correspond to very large flat spacetimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Dec 2002 18:55:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Jan 2003 18:48:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 15 May 2003 17:50:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
