Conservation implies that dynamo\ngeneration of large scale writhed structures is accompanied by the oppositely\nsigned twist along these structures. The latter is associated with the\nbackreaction force.

HI spectral line VLBI reveals atomic gas in front of both\njets. There appear to be three velocity systems. The deepest, at \"high\nvelocities\" (receding by 125 to 200 km/s), seems restricted to a shell 1 to 2\npc away from the core, within which this gas might be largely ionised. WSRT\nspectroscopy has revealed 1667 and 1665 MHz OH absorption with their line ratio\nvarying roughly from 1:1 to 2:1 between -35 and 200 km/s. In the high velocity\nsystem the OH profiles are similar to HI, suggesting co-location of that atomic\nand molecular gas, and leaving unclear the connection to the H2O masing gas\nseen elsewhere. We have also detected both 18cm OH satellite lines in the high\nvelocity system. They have conjugate profiles: 1612 MHz is in absorption, and\n1720 MHz in emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Dec 2002 12:49:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

This\nis supports the conclusion from recent neutron diffraction experiments that\nthere is no hydrophobic hydration around small hydrophobic groups. Analysis of\nthe electronic charge distribution using Wannier functions shows that the\ndipole moment of ethanol increases from 1.8 D to 3.1 D upon solvation, while\nthe apolar ethylene molecule attains an average dipole moment of 0.5 D. For\nethylene, we identified configurations with $\\pi$-H bonded water molecules,\nthat have rare four-fold hydrogen-bonded water coordination, yielding\ninstantaneous dipole moments of ethylene of up to 1 D. The results provide\nvaluable information for the improvement of empirical force fields, and point\nout that for an accurate description of the aqueous solvation of ethanol, and\neven of the apolar ethylene, polarizable force fields are required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Dec 2002 15:52:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We derive Hamilton -- Schr\\\"odinger equations for\nprobability amplitudes and averaged position and momentum of a point-like atom\ninteracting with the quantized field in a standing-wave cavity. They\nconstitute, in general, an infinite-dimensional set of equations with an\ninfinite number of integrals of motion which may be reduced to a dynamical\nsystem with four degrees of freedom if the quantized field is supposed to be\ninitially prepared in a Fock state. This system is found to produce semiquantum\nchaos with positive values of the maximal Lyapunov exponent. At large values of\ndetuning $|\\delta|\\gg 1$, the Rabi atomic oscillations are usually shallow, and\nthe dynamics is found to be almost regular. The Doppler -- Rabi resonance, deep\nRabi oscillations that may occur at any large value of $|\\delta|$ to be equal\nto $|\\alpha p_0|$, is found numerically and described analytically (with\n$\\alpha$ to be the normalized recoil frequency and $p_0$ the initial atomic\nmomentum). Two gedanken experiments are proposed to detect manifestations of\nsemiquantum chaos in real experiments. In the chaotic regime values of the\npopulation inversion $z_{out}$, measured with atoms after transversing a\ncavity, are so sensitive to small changes in the initial inversion $z_{in}$\nthat the probability of detecting any value of $z_{out}$ in the admissible\ninterval becomes almost unity in a short time. Chaotic wandering of a two-level\natom in a quantized Fock field is shown to be fractal. Fractal-like structures,\ntypical for chaotic scattering, are numerically found in the dependence of the\ntime of exit of atoms from the cavity on their initial momenta.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Dec 2002 05:58:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
