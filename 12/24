By the Basic assumption that the major black hole growth occurs during\nthe luminous AGN phase, the luminosity function of AGNs as a function of\nredshift traces not only the accretion history of the black holes but also the\ncosmic star formation history of the spheroids.\n  Although the space density of the especially luminous QSOs is very low, we\nshow that the total amount of star formation associated with the massive black\nhole growth is almost the same as that of Lyman Break Galaxies detected by the\ncurrent optical deep surveys. We thus argue that the optical deep surveys may\nmiss about half of the net star formation in our Universe, This is probably due\nto in part significant dust extinction as well as the small field of view of\nprevious optical surveys which cannot sample such rare events with relatively\nshort time scale.

This led us to study a notion of\n\\textit{model topos} (orginally due to C. Rezk), a model category version of\nthe notion of Grothendieck topos. In this paper we treat the analogous theory\nstarting from (1-)Segal categories in place of S-categories and model\ncategories. We introduce notions of Segal topologies, Segal sites and stacks\nover them. We define an abstract notion of Segal topos and relate it with Segal\ncategories of stacks over Segal sites. We compare the notions of Segal topoi\nand of model topoi, showing that the two theories are equivalent in some sense.\nHowever, the existence of a nice Segal category of morphisms between Segal\ncategories allows us to improve the treatment of topoi in this context.

Because these do not need to be normalized we\nfind that they map onto a Minkowskian future cone in $\\mathbb{E}^{1,3}$, whose\nvertical cross-sections are nothing but Bloch spheres. Pure states are\nrepresented by light-like vectors, unitary operations correspond to special\northogonal transforms about the axis of the cone, positive operations\ncorrespond to pure Lorentz boosts. We formalize the equivalence between the\ngeneralized measurement formalism on qubit states and the Lorentz\ntransformations of special relativity, or more precisely elements of the\nrestricted Lorentz group together with future-directed null boosts. The note\nends with a discussion of the equivalence and some of its possible\nconsequences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Dec 2002 00:31:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Jan 2003 16:22:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 10 May 2003 16:51:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
