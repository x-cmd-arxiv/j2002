This result is surprising within\nthe framework of internal shock models, since spectral shifts associated with\nthe jet's blue shift (by a Lorentz factor of Gamma) and the cosmological red\nshift (by a factor of 1+z) should cause substantial smearing in the\ndistribution of the spectral peak in the jet's co-moving frame, E_rest. For the\ngeneral case where the luminosity (L) varies as Gamma^N and E_rest varies as\nGamma^M, then the observed E_peak will vary as L^{(M+1)/N}(1+z)^{-1}. For two\nindependent set of 20 and 84 bursts, E_peak(1+z) varies as a power law of the\nluminosity with an index of (M+1)/N=0.36+-0.03. With this measured value, the\nabove functional dependence of E_peak on L and z results in E_peak being\nroughly constant for bursts of similar peak flux, P_256. Thus, the kinematic\nsmearing will be small, hence allowing the E_peak distribution to be narrow.\nThis model also predicts that bright bursts will have high E_peak values\nbecause they all have some combination of high luminosity (and hence a large\nblue shift Gamma) and a nearby distance (and hence a small cosmological red\nshift). Quantitatively, E_peak should vary roughly as P_256^0.36, and this\nmodel prediction is strikingly confirmed with BATSE data by Mallozzi et al. A\nprediction of this model is that GRBs at very high red shift z~10 should all\nappear with E_peak at ~200 keV. A further prediction of this model is that\nnormal bursts with P_256 below the BATSE trigger threshold will appear as x-ray\nflashes with E_peak~70 keV; just as is reported by Kippen et al. and Heise et\nal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Dec 2002 18:33:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Adopting the kinematic approximation where the dynamical\neffects of magnetic fields are ignored, we exactly solve Maxwell's equations\nwith the assumptions that the geodesic motion of the fluid is stationary and\naxisymmetric, the magnetic field has only radial and azimuthal components and\ndepends only on time and radial coordinates. We show that the stationary state\nof the magnetic field in the plunging region is uniquely determined by the\nboundary conditions at the marginally stable circular orbit. If the magnetic\nfield at the marginally stable circular orbit is in a stationary state, the\nmagnetic field in the plunging region will quickly settle into a stationary\nstate if it is not so initially, in a time determined by the dynamical time\nscale. The radial component of the magnetic field at the marginally stable\ncircular orbit is more important than the toroidal component in determining the\nstructure and evolution of the magnetic field in the plunging region. Even if\nat the marginally stable circular orbit the toroidal component is zero, in the\nplunging region a toroidal component is quickly generated from the radial\ncomponent by the shear motion of the fluid. Finally, we show that the dynamical\neffects of magnetic fields are unimportant in the plunging region if they are\nnegligible on the marginally stable circular orbit.

This issue is of particular\ninterest at the present time since most of the observed multiple lens systems\nhave magnification ratios and image geometries that are not well-fit by\nstandard mass models. The presence of substructure exterior to the lens has\nbeen invoked by several authors in the context of Cold Dark Matter (CDM) models\nin order to explain the anamolous magnification ratios. We emphasize that the\nanomalous magnification ratios may be an artifact of the simple one-component\nmass models currently in use; the inclusion of a misaligned disk may be able to\nmimic the effect of substructure. These slight spatial offsets between the dark\nmatter halo and the disk, which are likely to occur during or as a consequence\nof interactions or mergers, lead to complex image configurations and\nnon-standard magnification ratios.

Superfluidity allows\ndifferent superfluid (and superconducting) species of particles to have\nindependent fluid flows, a consequence of which is that the fluid equations of\nmotion contain as many fluid element velocities as superfluid species. Whenever\nthe particles of one superfluid interact with those of another, the momentum of\neach superfluid will be a linear combination of both superfluid velocities.\nThis leads to the so-called entrainment effect whereby the motion of one\nsuperfluid will induce a momentum in the other superfluid. We have constructed\na fully relativistic model for entrainment between superfluid neutrons and\nsuperconducting protons using a relativistic $\\sigma - \\omega$ mean field model\nfor the nucleons and their interactions. In this context there are two notions\nof ``relativistic'': relativistic motion of the individual nucleons with\nrespect to a local region of the star (i.e. a fluid element containing, say, an\nAvogadro's number of particles), and the motion of fluid elements with respect\nto the rest of the star. While it is the case that the fluid elements will\ntypically maintain average speeds at a fraction of that of light, the\nsupranuclear densities in the core of a neutron star can make the nucleons\nthemselves have quite high average speeds within each fluid element. The\nformalism is applied to the problem of slowly-rotating superfluid neutron star\nconfigurations, a distinguishing characteristic being that the neutrons can\nrotate at a rate different from that of the protons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Dec 2002 21:21:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

For the particular case of the Cournot's Duopoly, we find\nthat, even though the two players both act as \"selfishly\" in the quantum game\nas they do in the classical game, they are found to virtually cooperate due to\nthe quantum entanglement between them. We also find that the original\nEinstein-Podolksy-Rosen state contributes to the best profits that the two\nfirms could ever attain.

Currently Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) has been the forerunner\nby demonstrating a majority of quantum algorithms. In NMR, spin systems\nconsisting of coupled nuclear spins are utilized as qubits. In order to carry\nout QIP, a spin system has to meet two major requirements: (i) qubit\naddressability and (ii) mutual coupling among the qubits. It has been\ndemonstrated that the magnitude of the mutual coupling among qubits can be\nincreased by orienting the spin-systems in a liquid crystal matrix and\nutilizing the residual dipolar couplings. While utilizing residual dipolar\ncouplings may be useful to increase the number of qubits, nuclei of same\nspecies (homonuclei) might become strongly coupled. In strongly coupled\nspin-systems, spins loose their individual identity of being qubits. We propose\nthat even such strongly coupled spin-systems can be used for QIP and the\nqubit-manipulation can be achieved by transition-selective pulses. We\ndemonstrate experimental preparation of pseudopure states, creation of\nmaximally entangled states, implementation logic gates and implementation of\nDeutsch-Jozsa (DJ) algorithm in strongly coupled 2,3 and 4 spin systems. The\nenergy levels of the strongly coupled 3 and 4 spin systems were obtained by\nusing a Z-COSY experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Dec 2002 11:46:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Nov 2003 19:06:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
