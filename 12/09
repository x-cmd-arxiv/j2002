Chemical models based on rate equations including both gas phase and\ngrain surface reactions have been used in order to simulate the formation of\nchemical complexity in interstellar clouds. For reactions in the gas phase and\non large grains, rate equations, which are highly efficient to simulate, are an\nideal tool. However, for small grains under low flux, the typical number of\natoms or molecules of certain reactive species on a grain may go down to order\none or less. In this case the discrete nature of the opulations of reactive\nspecies as well as the fluctuations become dominant, thus the mean-field\napproximation on which the rate equations are based does not apply. Recently, a\nmaster equation approach, that provides a good description of chemical\nreactions on interstellar dust grains, was proposed. Here we present a related\napproach based on moment equations that can be obtained from the master\nequation. These equations describe the time evolution of the moments of the\ndistribution of the population of the various chemical species on the grain. An\nadvantage of this approach is the fact that the production rates of molecular\nspecies are expressed directly in terms of these moments. Here we use the\nmoment equations to calculate the rate of molecular hydrogen formation on small\ngrains. It is shown that the moment equation approach is efficient in this case\nin which only a single reactive specie is involved. The set of equations for\nthe case of two species is presented and the difficulties in implementing this\napproach for complex reaction networks involving multiple species are\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Dec 2002 14:17:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The\nAWAXS measurements were performed at eight different incident photon energies,\nincluding some close to the Ni and Zr K edges. From the measurements eight\ntotal structure factor S(K,E) were derived. Using the AWAXS data four\ndifferential structure factors DSFi(K,Em,En) were derived, two about the Ni and\nZr edges. The partial structure factors SNi-Ni(K), SNi-Zr(K) and SZr-Zr(K) were\nestimated by using two different methods. First, the S(K,E) and DSFi(K,Em,En)\nfactors were combined and used in a matrix inversion process. Second, three\nS(K,E) factors were used as input data in the RMC technique. The coordination\nnumbers and interatomic distances for the first neighbors extracted from the\npartial structure factors obtained by these two methods show a good agreement.\nBy using the three-dimensional structure derived from the RMC simulations, the\nbond-angle distributions were calculated and they suggest the presence of\ndistorted triangular-faced polyhedral units in the amorphous NiZr2 structure.\nWe have used the Warren chemical short-range order parameter to evaluate the\nchemical short-range order for the amorphous NiZr2 alloy and for the NiZr2\ncompound. The calculated values show that the chemical short-range order found\nin these two materials is similar to that found in a solid solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Dec 2002 17:58:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The task of automatic keyphrase extraction is to select keyphrases\nfrom within the text of a given document. Automatic keyphrase extraction makes\nit feasible to generate keyphrases for the huge number of documents that do not\nhave manually assigned keyphrases. Good performance on this task has been\nobtained by approaching it as a supervised learning problem. An input document\nis treated as a set of candidate phrases that must be classified as either\nkeyphrases or non-keyphrases. To classify a candidate phrase as a keyphrase,\nthe most important features (attributes) appear to be the frequency and\nlocation of the candidate phrase in the document. Recent work has demonstrated\nthat it is also useful to know the frequency of the candidate phrase as a\nmanually assigned keyphrase for other documents in the same domain as the given\ndocument (e.g., the domain of computer science). Unfortunately, this\nkeyphrase-frequency feature is domain-specific (the learning process must be\nrepeated for each new domain) and training-intensive (good performance requires\na relatively large number of training documents in the given domain, with\nmanually assigned keyphrases). The aim of the work described here is to remove\nthese limitations. In this paper, I introduce new features that are derived by\nmining lexical knowledge from a very large collection of unlabeled data,\nconsisting of approximately 350 million Web pages without manually assigned\nkeyphrases. I present experiments that show that the new features result in\nimproved keyphrase extraction, although they are neither domain-specific nor\ntraining-intensive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Dec 2002 18:52:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Recent commercial software, such as\nMicrosoft's Word 97 and Verity's Search 97, includes algorithms that\nautomatically extract keyphrases from documents. In this paper, we approach the\nproblem of automatically extracting keyphrases from text as a supervised\nlearning task.

Employing these amplitudes, we\nderive the corresponding weak axial heavy meson exchange currents in the\nleading order in the 1/M expansion ($M$ is the nucleon mass), suitable for the\nnuclear physics calculations beyond the threshold energies and with wave\nfunctions obtained by solving the Schr\\\"odinger equation with one--boson\nexchange potentials. The constructed currents obey the nuclear form of the\npartial conservation of the axial current. We apply the space component of\nthese currents in calculations of the cross sections for the disintegration of\ndeuterons by low energy (anti)neutrinos. The deuteron and the final state\nnucleon--nucleon wave functions are derived (i) from a variant of the OBEPQB\npotential, and (ii) from the Nijmegen 93 and Nijmegen I nucleon-nucleon\ninteraction. The extracted values of the constant $L_{1, A}$, entering the\naxial exchange currents of the pionless effective field theory, are in a\nreasonable agreement with its value predicted by the dimensional analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Dec 2002 13:35:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2002 13:35:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 2 Dec 2003 11:41:51 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2005 11:09:36 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2006 11:31:49 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 28 Feb 2007 09:42:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
