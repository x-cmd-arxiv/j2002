It is\nnecessary to solve the question: which type of neutrino transitions\n(oscillations) is realized in nature? There can be three types of neutrino\ntransitions (oscillations). At present it is considered that Dirac and Majorana\nneutrino oscillations can be realized. It is shown that we cannot put Majorana\nneutrinos in the standard weak interactions theory without violation of the\ngauge invariance. Then it is obvious that there can be only realized\ntransitions (oscillations) between Dirac neutrinos with different flowers. Also\nit is shown that the mechanism of resonance enhancement of neutrino\noscillations in matter cannot be realized without violation of the law of\nenergy-momentum conservation. Though it is supposed that we see neutrino\noscillations in experiments, indeed there only transitions between neutrinos\nare registered. In order to register neutrino oscillations it is necessary to\nsee second or even higher neutrino oscillation modes in experiments.

We then\ninvestigate the effect of a recently introduced novel coupling potential which\nhas been remarkably successful in reproducing the experimental data for the\n$^{12}$C+$^{12}$C, $^{12}$C+$^{24}$Mg and $^{16}$O+$^{28}$Si reactions over a\nwide range of energies. This coupling potential has the effect of deepening the\nreal elastic potential in the surface region, thereby explaining a common\nfeature of many phenomenological potentials. It is suggested that one can\nrelate this deepening to the super-deformed state of the compound nucleus,\n$^{24}$Mg.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Dec 2002 11:43:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
