Valence quarks and gluons are streaming in the\nopposite directions when viewed in the c.m. of the produced system. The\nresulting pattern of the fragmentation of the colliding nuclei leads to an\nimplosion of the quark and gluon constituents of the nuclei. The matter density\nproduced at the initial stage in the nucleus fragmentation region is estimated\nto be $\\geq$ 50 GeV/fm$^3$ at the LHC energies and probably $\\geq$ 10\nGeV/fm$^3$ at RHIC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Dec 2002 18:11:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Jul 2003 21:14:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The focus will be on the use of LEO GNSS data, exploiting GNSS\nReflections, Navigation and Occultation TEC measurements. In order to attack\nthis question, we have simulated GNSS ionospheric TEC data as it would be\nmeasured from a polar LEO (exploiting Navigation, Occultation and Reflection\nTEC data) and IGS ground stations, through the use of a climatic ionospheric\nmodel (we have explored both NeQuick and PIM). We have then developed a new\ntomographic approach inspired on the physics of the hydrogen atom, which has\nbeen compared to previous successful but somewhat awkward methods (using a\nvoxel representation) and employed to retrieve the Electronic Density field\nfrom the simulated TEC data. These tomographic inversion results using\nsimulated data demonstrate the significant impact of GNSS-R and GNSS-NO data:\n3D ionospheric Electron Density fields are retrieved over the oceans quite\naccurately, even as, in the spirit of this initial study, the simulation and\ninversion approaches avoided intensive computation and sophisticated\nalgorithmic elements (spatio-temporal smoothing). We conclude that GNSS-R data\ncan contribute significantly to the GIOS (Global/GNSS Ionospheric Observation\nSystem).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Dec 2002 17:29:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
