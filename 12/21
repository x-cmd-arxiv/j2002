A binary\nejects stars by the gravitational slingshot and carves out a loss cone in the\nhost galaxy. Continued decay of the binary requires a refilling of the loss\ncone. We show that the standard treatment of loss cone refilling, derived for\ncollisionally relaxed systems like globular clusters, can substantially\nunderestimate the refilling rates in galactic nuclei. We derive expressions for\nnon-equilibrium loss-cone dynamics and calculate time scales for the decay of\nmassive black hole binaries following galaxy mergers, obtaining significantly\nhigher decay rates than heretofore. Even in the absence of two-body relaxation,\ndecay of binaries can persist due to repeated ejection of stars returning to\nthe nucleus on eccentric orbits. We show that this recycling of stars leads to\na gradual, approximately logarithmic dependence of the binary binding energy on\ntime. We derive an expression for the loss cone refilling induced by the\nBrownian motion of a black hole binary. We also show that numerical N-body\nexperiments are not well suited to probe these mechanisms over long times due\nto spurious relaxation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Dec 2002 20:49:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Aug 2003 07:48:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We solve the\nradial momentum equation for solutions corresponding to an accretion flow that\nstarts from a subsonic state at infinity, smoothly passes the fast critical\npoint, then supersonically falls into the horizon of the black hole. The\nsolutions always have the following features: 1) The specific energy of fluid\nparticles remains constant but the specific angular momentum is effectively\nremoved by the magnetic field. 2) At large radii, where the disk motion is\ndominantly rotational, the energy density of the magnetic field is\nequipartitioned with the rotational energy density of the disk. 3) Inside the\nfast critical point, where radial motion becomes important, the ratio of the\nelectromagnetic energy density to the kinetic energy density drops quickly. The\nresults indicate that: 1) Disk accretion does not necessarily imply energy\ndissipation since magnetic fields do not have to transport or dissipate a lot\nof energy as they effectively transport angular momentum. 2) When resistivity\nis small, the large-scale magnetic field is amplified by the shearing rotation\nof the disk until the magnetic energy density is equipartitioned with the\nrotational energy density, ending up with a geometrically thick disk. This is\nin contrast with the evolution of small-scale magnetic fields where if the\nresistivity is nonzero the magnetic energy density is likely to be\nequipartitioned with the kinetic energy density associated with local random\nmotions (e.g., turbulence), making a thin Keplerian disk possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Dec 2002 18:58:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 May 2003 20:37:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The mechanism of the theory is a certain 2d nonlinear model, the\nlambda-model, whose target manifold is the manifold of general nonlinear models\nof the worldsurface, the background spacetimes for string scattering. So far,\nthe theory has only been formulated and its basic working described, in general\nterms. The theory's only claims to interest at present are matters of general\nprinciple.

For a real metal,\nhowever, approximately obeying the Drude dispersive model at low frequencies,\nwe find that the zero-frequency transverse electric mode does not contribute at\nall.
