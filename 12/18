The simulation\nfollows the collapse and fragmentation of a large-scale turbulent molecular\ncloud to form a stellar cluster and, simultaneously, the formation of\ncircumstellar discs and binary stars. This large range of scales enables us to\npredict a wide variety of stellar properties for comparison with observations.\nThe calculation clearly demonstrates that star formation is a highly-dynamic\nand chaotic process. Star-disc encounters form binaries and truncate discs.\nStellar encounters disrupt bound multiple systems. The cloud produces roughly\nequal numbers of stars and brown dwarfs, with masses down to the opacity limit\nfor fragmentation (~5 Jupiter masses). The initial mass function is consistent\nwith a Salpeter slope (Gamma=-1.35) above 0.5 Msun, a roughly flat distribution\n(Gamma=0) in the range 0.006-0.5 Msun, and a sharp cutoff below ~0.005 Msun.\nThis is consistent with recent observational surveys. The brown dwarfs form by\nthe dynamical ejection of low-mass fragments from dynamically unstable multiple\nsystems before the fragments have been able to accrete to stellar masses. Close\nbinary systems (with separations <10 AU) are not formed by fragmentation in\nsitu. Rather, they are produced by hardening of initially wider multiple\nsystems through a combination of dynamical encounters, gas accretion, and/or\nthe interaction with circumbinary and circumtriple discs. Finally, we find that\nthe majority of circumstellar discs have radii less than 20 AU due to\ntruncation in dynamical encounters. This is consistent with observations of the\nOrion Trapezium Cluster and implies that most stars and brown dwarfs do not\nform large planetary systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 2002 17:03:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-05"}

As a possible explanation we propose that the CP is due to Faraday\nconversion (FC) of linear polarisation (LP) synchrotron light which propagates\nalong a line-of-sight (LOS) through twisted magnetic fields. The rotational\nnature of accretion flows onto black holes naturally generates the required\nmagnetic twist in the emission region, independent of whether it is a jet or an\nADAF. The expected twist in both types of flows is of the order of what is\nrequired for optimal CP generation. This scenario requires that Faraday\nrotation (FR) is insignificant in the emission region. Although this is an\nassumption, it relaxes constraints on the plasma parameters, that were given in\nscenarios which rely on FR, since there the strength of FR can not be too far\nfrom the optimum. The proposed mechanism works in electron-positron (e+-) as\nwell as electron-proton (e/p) plasma. In the latter case, the emission region\nshould consist of individual flux tubes with independent polarities in order to\nsuppress too strong FR. The predominant CP is expected to mostly counter-rotate\n(rotation is measured here in sky-projection) with respect to the central\nengine in all cases (jet or ADAF, e+- or e/p plasma). If the proposed mechanism\nis indeed operating, it will allow to measure the sense of rotation of quasar\nengines. The engine of SgrA* is then expected to rotate clockwise and therefore\ncounter-Galactic, as do the young hot stars in its vicinity, which are thought\nto feed SgrA* by their winds. Similarly, we expect the microquasars SS 443 and\nGRS 1915+105 to rotate clockwise.

As an example we have chosen N\ninfinitely thin hard rods with length L, fixed with their centers on a periodic\nlattice with lattice constant a. Starting from the N-rod Smoluchowski equation\nwe derive a coupled set of equations for fluctuations of reduced k-rod\ndensities. We approximate the influence of the surrounding rods onto the\ndynamics of a pair of rods by introduction of an effective rotational diffusion\ntensor D and in this way we obtain a self-consistent equation for D. This\nequation exhibits a feedback mechanism leading to a slowing down of the\nrelaxation. It involves as an input the Laplace transform v_0(l/r) at z=0,\nl=L/a, of a torque-torque correlator of an isolated pair of rods with distance\nR=ar.

Typically, this happens gradually and asymptotically after a certain\ncharacteristic decoherence time. For the Wigner-function, however, one can\nprove that it evolves perfectly into a classical (non-negative) phase space\ndistribution after a finite time of decoherence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 2002 20:33:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
