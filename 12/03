The abundances of Si, S, Ar, Ca and Fe\nshow strong decreasing gradients outside 2$'$ and become nearly constant within\nthe radius at $\\sim1.5$ solar.

The Mg abundance is\n$\\sim$1 solar within 2$'$, which is close to stellar abundance within the same\nradius. The O/Si/Fe pattern of M~87 is located at the simple extension of that\nof Galactic stars. The observed Mg/O ratio is about 1.25 solar, which is also\nthe same ratio as for Galactic stars. The O/Si/Fe ratio indicates that the SN\nIa contribution to Si and Fe becomes important towards the center and SN Ia\nproducts have similar abundances of Si and Fe at least around M~87, which may\nreflect dimmer SN Ia observed in old stellar systems. The S abundance is\nsimilar to the Si abundance at the center, but has a steeper gradient.

The original proposal had a\nweakness in that it involved a hidden extreme sensitivity to the size of the\nforce. Also, the physical origin of this force was not fully addressed. Here,\nwe discuss the sensitivity and present a way to avoid it by choosing the\nspatial form of the pushing force in an optimal way. We also analyse the effect\nof imperfections in a pair of pi pulses which are used to implement a\n\"spin-echo\" to cancel correlated errors. We present a physical model for the\nforce, namely the dipole force, and discuss the impact of unwanted photon\nscattering, and of finite temperature of the ions. The main effect of the\ntemperature is to blur the phase of the gate owing to the ions exploring a\nrange of values of the force. When the distance scale of the force profile is\nsmaller than the ion separation, this effect is more important than the\nhigh-order terms in the Coulomb repulsion which were originally discussed.\nOverall, we find that whereas the \"pushing gate\" is not as resistant to\nimperfections as was supposed, it remains a significant candidate for ion trap\nquantum computing since it does not require ground state cooling, and in some\ncases it does not require the Lamb-Dicke limit, while the gate rate is fast,\nclose to (rather than small compared to) the trap vibrational frequency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Dec 2002 18:18:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
