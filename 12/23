To\nthis end we use SPH simulations in gravitational potentials determined from the\nNIR luminosity distribution (including spiral arms) which are based on the\nCOBE/DIRBE maps. Gas flows in models which include massive spiral arms clearly\nmatch the observed 12CO lvplot better than if the potential does not include\nspiral structure. Besides single pattern speed models we investigate models\nwith separate pattern speeds for the bar and spiral arms. The most important\ndifference is that in the latter case the gas spiral arms go through the bar\ncorotation region, keeping the gas aligned with the arms there. In the (l,v)\nplot this results in characteristic regions which appear to be nearly void of\ngas.In single pattern speed models these regions are filled with gas because\nthe spiral arms dissolve in the bar corotation region. Comparing with the 12CO\ndata we find evidence for separate pattern speeds in the Milky Way.From a\nseries of models the preferred range for the bar pattern speed is Om_p=60\\pm5\n/Gyr, corresponding to corotation at 3.4\\pm0.3kpc. The spiral pattern speed is\nless well constrained, but our preferred value is Om_sp\\approx 20 /Gyr.

We extend\ntheir study to the flare model, which postulates the release of a large X-ray\nflux above a small region of the accretion disc. A fundamental difference with\nthe lamppost model is that the region of the disc below the flare is not\nilluminated before the onset of the flare.\n  A few test models show that the spectrum which follows immediately the\nincrease in continuum flux should display the characteristics of a highly\nilluminated but dense gas, i.e. very intense X-ray emission lines and\nionization edges in the soft X-ray range. The behaviour of the iron line is\ndifferent in the case of a \"moderate\" and a ``strong'' flare: for a moderate\nflare, the spectrum displays a neutral component of the Fe K$\\alpha$ line at\n6.4 keV, gradually leading to more highly ionized lines. For a strong flare,\nthe lines are already emitted by FeXXV (around 6.7 keV) after the onset, and\nhave an equivalent width of several hundreds of eV. We find that the observed\ncorrelations between $R$, $\\Gamma$, and the X-ray flux, are well accounted by a\ncombination of flares having not achieved pressure equilibrium, strongly\nsuggesting that the observed spectrum is dominated by regions in non-pressure\nequilibrium, typical of the onset of the flares.

To do this, we first reduce the usual matrix\nvalued Weyl equation on the Euclidian space to the one on the superspace,\ncalled the super Weyl equation. Using analysis on superspace, we may associate\na function, called the super Hamiltonian function, corresponding to that super\nWeyl equation. Starting from this super Hamiltonian function, we define phase\nand amplitude functions which are solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation and\nthe continuity equation on the superspace, respectively.

Whereas the standard Hilbert space axiom\ndoes not distinguish mathematically between the space of states (in-states of\nscattering theory) and the space of observables (out-``states'' of scattering\ntheory) the new axiom associates states and observables to two different Hardy\nsubspaces which are dense in the same Hilbert space and analytic in the lower\nand upper complex energy plane, respectively. As a consequence of this new\naxiom the dynamical equations (Schr\\\"{o}dinger or Heisenberg) integrate to a\nsemigroup evolution. Extending this new Hardy space axiom to a relativistic\ntheory provides a relativistic theory of resonance scattering and decay with\nBorn probablilities that fulfill Einstein causality and the exponential decay\nlaw.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Dec 2002 17:02:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2003 10:46:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

Instead of considering an empty dot, we study the situations\nthat two input electrons co-tunnel through the quantum dot occupied by one or\ntwo dot electrons. We show that electron entanglement can be generated via the\nco-tunneling processes when the dot is occupied by two electrons, yielding\nnon-local spin-singlet states at the output leads. When the dot is occupied by\na single electron, net spin-singlet final states could be generated by\ninjecting polarized electrons to the dot system. When the input electrons are\nunpolarized, we show that by carefully arranging model parameters non-local\nspin-triplet electrons can also be obtained at the output leads if the\ndot-electron spin remains unchanged in the final state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Dec 2002 10:47:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Feb 2003 19:03:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
