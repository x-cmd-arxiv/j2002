We also explain the hysteretic\nbehavior and other previous tunneling results so far not understood\nsatisfactorily, attributing them to a combination of node removal and Doppler\nshift of low energy surface bound states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2002 16:46:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Dec 2002 07:53:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 22 Dec 2002 06:39:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

States with magnetization M=0,\ntotal spin 0<=S<=15 and labeled by two (out of four) one-dimensional\nirreducible representations (irreps) of the point symmetry group D_6 are taken\ninto account. This choice follows from importance of these irreps in analyzing\nlow-lying states in each S-multiplet. Taking into account the Clebsch--Gordan\ncoefficients for coupling total spins of sublattices (SA=SB=15/2) the global\nNeel probability p*_N can be determined. Dependencies of these quantities on\nstate energy (per bond and in the units of exchange integral J) and the total\nspin S are analyzed. Providing we have determined p_N(S) etc. for other\nantiferromagnetic rings (Fe10, for instance) we could try to approximate\nresults for the largest synthesized ferric wheel Fe18. Since thermodynamic\nproperties of Fe6 have been investigated recently, in the present\nconsiderations they are not discussed, but only used to verify obtained values\nof eigenenergies. Numerical results re calculated with high precision using two\nmain tools: (i) thorough analysis of symmetry properties including methods of\nalgebraic combinatorics and (ii) multiple precision arithmetic library GMP. The\nsystem considered yields more than 45 thousands basic states (the so-called\nIsing configurations), but application of the method proposed reduces this\nproblem to 20-dimensional eigenproblem for the ground state (S=0). The largest\neigenproblem has to be solved for S=4; its dimension is 60. These two facts\n(high precision and small resultant eigenproblems) confirm efficiency and\nusefulness of such an approach, so it is briefly discussed here.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Dec 2002 08:31:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The pion decay constant $f_{\\pi}(T, \\mu_{I})$ is\nalso analized. As a function of temperature for $\\mu_I =0$, the mass remains\nquite stable, starting to grow for very high values of $T$, confirming previous\nresults. However, there are interesting corrections to the mass when both\neffects (temperature and chemical potential) are simultaneously present. At\nzero temperature the $\\pi ^{\\pm}$ should condensate when $\\mu_{I} = \\mp\nm_{\\pi}$. This is not longer valid anymore at finite $T$. The mass of the\n$\\pi_0$ acquires also a non trivial dependence on $\\mu_I$ due to the finite\ntemperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2002 22:29:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Dec 2002 16:38:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 26 Dec 2002 16:25:54 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 21 Jan 2003 16:33:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Despite of the non-commutativity between\nfunctions and (generalized) differential forms, for the subclass of\n``bicovariant'' group lattices considered in this work it is possible to\nunderstand central geometric objects like metric, torsion and curvature as\n``tensors'' with (left) covariance properties. This ensures that tensor\ncomponents (with respect to a basis of the space of 1-forms) transform in the\nfamiliar homogeneous way under a change of basis. There is a natural\ncompatibility condition for a metric and a linear connection. The resulting\n(pseudo-) Riemannian geometry is explored in this work. It is demonstrated that\nthe components of the metric are indeed able to properly describe properties of\ndiscrete geometries like lengths and angles. A simple geometric understanding\nin particular of torsion and curvature is achieved. The formalism has much in\ncommon with lattice gauge theory. For example, the Riemannian curvature is\ndetermined by parallel transport of vectors around a plaquette (which\ncorresponds to a biangle, a triangle or a quadrangle).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2002 17:09:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
