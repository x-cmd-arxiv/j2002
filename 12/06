Through the light-quark-mass ratio m_u / m_d, leading order\nChiral Perturbation Theory appears to rule this scenario out.

Decay via $^1P_1\\to {^1D_2}\\to {^3P_2}$\ncontinuously loads a magnetic trap formed by the quadrupole magnetic field of\nthe MOT. Over $10^8$ atoms at a density of $8 \\times 10^9$ cm$^{-3}$ and\ntemperature of 1 mK are trapped. The atom temperature is significantly lower\nthan what would be expected from the kinetic and potential energy of atoms as\nthey are transferred from the MOT. This suggests that thermalization and\nevaporative cooling are occurring in the magnetic trap.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2002 19:40:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

At first, do not exist restrictions for the mathematical form\nof the action function, nonetheless, as in the a posteriori developer of the\nanalytic physics, the traditional equations of the physics lead up to a scalar\naction, it is always sure that the action may be a scalar function.

We call tensorial\naction to this original function and their components are connecting, directly,\nwith the tensorial (spinorial) componets of the wave function of the particles\nwith spin higher than zero.
