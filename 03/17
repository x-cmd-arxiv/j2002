Over the field k=Q, we show that the elliptic quotients of the\ncurves with automorphisms D_8 and D_{12} are precisely the Q-curves of degrees\n2 and 3, respectively, and we determine which curves have jacobians of\nGL_2-type.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Mar 2002 10:55:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The\nadiabatic and quasi-adiabatic pulses have an important property that within\ntheir activation bandwidth flip angle of the pulses is independent of the pulse\nduration and the bandwidth increases as the pulse duration. This property is\nimportanr for construction of the heteronuclear Hartmann-Hahn transfer\nsequences with the quasi-adiabatic 90 degree pulses. Theoretic analysis and\nnumerical simulation show that the heteronuclear Hartmann-Hahn transfer is\nperformed in the even-order multiple- quantum operator algebra subspace of the\ntwo-spin system. The multiple-quantum operator algebra space formalism may give\na powerful guide to the construction of ultra- broadband heteronuclear\nHartmann-Hahn transfer sequences with the quasi-adiabatic 90 degree pulses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Mar 2002 19:44:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 May 2002 03:29:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
