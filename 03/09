Our main findings are: (i) The lensing\nprobability should be 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than for conventional\nsurveys. The expected fraction of multiply-imaged quasars is highly sensitive\nto redshift and the uncertain slope of the bright end of the luminosity\nfunction, beta_h. For beta_h=2.58 (3.43) we find that at z~4.3 and i*<20.0 the\nfraction is ~4% (13%) while at z~6 and z*<20.2 the fraction is ~7% (30%). (ii)\nThe distribution of magnifications is heavily skewed; sources having the\nredshift and luminosity of the SDSS z>5.8 quasars acquire median magnifications\nof med(mu_obs)~1.1-1.3 and mean magnifications of <mu_obs>~5-50. Estimates of\nthe quasar luminosity density at high redshift must therefore filter out\ngravitationally-lensed sources. (iii) The flux in the Gunn-Peterson trough of\nthe highest redshift (z=6.28) quasar is known to be f_lambda<3 10^-19\nerg/sec/cm^2/Angstrom. Should this quasar be multiply imaged, we estimate a 40%\nchance that light from the lens galaxy would have contaminated the same part of\nthe quasar spectrum with a higher flux. Hence, spectroscopic studies of the\nepoch of reionization need to account for the possibility that a lens galaxy,\nwhich boosts the quasar flux, also contaminates the Gunn-Peterson trough. (iv)\nMicrolensing by stars should result in ~1/3 of multiply imaged quasars in the\nz>5.8 catalog varying by more than 0.5 magnitudes over the next decade. The\nmedian equivalent width would be lowered by ~20% with respect to the intrinsic\nvalue due to differential magnification of the continuum and emission-line\nregions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Mar 2002 20:40:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 May 2002 21:07:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
