The supergiants were identified in previously\npublished stellar photometry measured from Hubble Space Telescope imaging. The\nhigh resolution imaging and low dust environment provided high photometric\naccuracy such that the main sequence and blue He-burning supergiants are\nclearly separated. This allows us to isolate the He-burning phase at both the\nred and blue ends of the so called ``blue-loops''. The B/R supergiant ratio\nprovides an observational constraint on the relative lifetimes of these two\nphases which is a sensitive test for convection, mass loss, and rotation\nparameters. These parameters have direct implications for the period-luminosity\nrelationship for Cepheid variable stars. Previous studies have used a single\nnumber to represent this ratio. However, since the B/R ratio is a fairly strong\nfunction of mass for a single age stellar population, both changes in recent\nstar formation rate and choice of luminosity cut-off can dramatically affect\nthe result. We have analyzed the ratio as a function of age, or equivalently,\nmass. This method eliminates the confusion of unknown star formation histories\nso that B/R can be a more reliable diagnostic tool.

The\nfunctional form of the observed ratio matches the model extremely well.\nHowever, the observed B/R ratio is lower than the model by a factor of two.\nThis result suggests that stellar rotation is an important effect in the\nevolution of these stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Mar 2002 17:38:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Strong, narrow\nradiative recombination continua (RRC) for several ions are also present,\nimplying that most of the observed soft-X-ray emission arises in\nlow-temperature (few eV) plasma.

With increasing redshift the\nfraction of this S0 galaxy population is observed to strongly decrease (e.g. by\na factor ~2-3 to z = 0.5) in favor of the spiral galaxy fraction while the\nnumber of bright ellipticals does not seem to change. The infalling field\ngalaxy population that successively builds up the cluster also is spiral rich\nand S0 poor. It has hence been suspected that galaxy transformation processes,\neither due to galaxy -- galaxy or to galaxy -- ICM interactions, are\nresponsible for this change. Complementing dynamical and morphological studies,\nwe use evolutionary synthesis models describing various possible effects of\nthose interactions on the star formation rates of the infalling spirals. We\nstudy the effects of starbursts of various strengths as well as of the\ntruncation of star formation on the color and luminosity evolution of model\ngalaxies of various spectral types.

An appropriate\nsemi-infinite extension of the stochastic model J is constructed. The relevant\nboundary terms of the action of the associated dynamic field theory are\nidentified, the implied boundary conditions are derived, and the\nrenormalization of the model in $d<6$ bulk dimensions is clarified. Two\ndistinct renormalization schemes are utilized. The first is a massless one\nbased on minimal subtraction of dimensional poles and the dimensionality\nexpansion about $d=6$. To overcome its problems in going below $d=4$\ndimensions, a massive one for fixed dimensions $d\\le 4$ is constructed. The\nresulting renormalization group (or Callan Symanzik) equations are exploited to\nobtain the scaling forms of surface quantities like the dynamic structure\nfactor. In conjunction with boundary operator expansions scaling relations\nfollow that relate the critical indices of the dynamic and static infrared\nsingularities of surface quantities to familiar \\emph{static} bulk and surface\nexponents. To test the predicted scaling forms and scaling-law expressions for\nthe critical exponents involved, accurate computer-simulation data are\npresented for the dynamic surface structure factor. These are in conformity\nwith our predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2002 10:39:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 May 2002 22:24:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

In the case of nonplanar local anomalies, a\ncancellation of the anomaly can be achieved by a Green-Schwarz mechanism. In an\nexample of D3 branes placed on orbifold singularity that leads to a chiral\ntheory, the mechanism involves twisted RR fields which propagate with zero\nnoncommutative momentum. Global anomalies are not cancelled and, in particular,\nthe decay pi0 --> 2 gamma is allowed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Mar 2002 21:08:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2002 15:09:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-19"}

Differentiation\nof cell types is found as a natural consequence of such a system. \"Stem cells\"\nthat either proliferate or differentiate to different types generally appear in\nthe system, where irreversible loss of multipotency is demonstrated. Robustness\nof the developmental process against microscopic and macroscopic perturbations\nis found and explained, while irreversibility in developmental process is\nanalyzed in terms of the gain of stability, loss of diversity and chaotic\ninstability.
