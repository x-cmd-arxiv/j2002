The presence of a large number of combination frequencies (linear\nsums or differences of the real modes) enabled us not only to test theoretical\npredictions but also to indirectly infer spherical and azimuthal degrees of\nreal modes that had no observed splittings.

The acceptance of the proposed\nconfiguration depends on the ratio of the fermionic determinants on the new and\noriginal configurations. We study this ratio as the function of the number of\nlinks that are changed in the heat bath update. We find that even when every\nlink of a given direction and parity of a 10fm^4 configuration is updated, the\naverage of the determinant ratio is still close to one and with the improved\nstochastic estimator the proposed change is accepted with about 20%\nprobability.

Using a Galerkin method and direct numerical simulations\nwe study the stability of the steady hexagonal patterns with respect to general\nside-band instabilities. In the presence of rotation steady and oscillatory\ninstabilities are identified. One of them leads to stable, homogeneously\noscillating hexagons. For sufficiently large rotation rates the stability\nballoon closes, rendering all steady hexagons unstable and leading to\nspatio-temporal chaos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 2002 23:56:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Actually,\nthe system contains two waves with a strong linear coupling between them, to\nwhich a third wave is then coupled. This model has two gaps in its linear\nspectrum. Realizations of this model can be made in terms of temporal or\nspatial evolution of optical fields in, respectively, a planar waveguide or a\nbulk-layered medium resembling a photonic-crystal fiber. Another physical\nsystem described by the same model is a set of three internal wave modes in a\ndensity-stratified fluid. A nonlinear analysis is performed for solitons which\nhave zero velocity in the reference frame in which the group velocity of the\nthird wave vanishes. Disregarding the self-phase modulation (SPM) term in the\nequation for the third wave, we find two coexisting families of solitons:\nregular ones, which may be regarded as a smooth deformation of the usual gap\nsolitons in a two-wave system, and cuspons with a singularity in the first\nderivative at their center. Even in the limit when the linear coupling of the\nthird wave to the first two vanishes, the soliton family remains drastically\ndifferent from that in the linearly uncoupled system; in this limit, regular\nsolitons whose amplitude exceeds a certain critical value are replaced by\npeakons. While the regular solitons, cuspons, and peakons are found in an exact\nanalytical form, their stability is tested numerically, which shows that they\nall may be stable. If the SPM terms are retained, we find that there again\ncoexist two different families of generic stable soliton solutions, namely,\nregular ones and peakons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Mar 2002 02:05:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
