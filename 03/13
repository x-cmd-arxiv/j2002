In these cosmological models the nuclear processes are\nsimilar to those of the r-process nucleosynthesis in gravitational collapse\nsupernova explosions.\n  Massive stars $\\geq 10 M_{\\odot}$ culminate their evolution by supernova\nexplosions which are presumed to be the most viable candidate site for the\nr-process nucleosynthesis. Even in the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements,\ninitial entropy and density at the surface of proto-neutron stars are so high\nthat nuclear statistical equilibrium favors production of abundant light\nnuclei. In such explosive circumstances many neutron-rich radioactive nuclei of\nlight-to-intermediate mass as well as heavy mass nuclei play the significant\nroles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2002 05:54:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This\nconstructive dimension is used to assign every individual (infinite, binary)\nsequence S a dimension, which is a real number dim(S) in the interval [0,1].\nSequences that are random (in the sense of Martin-Lof) have dimension 1, while\nsequences that are decidable, \\Sigma^0_1, or \\Pi^0_1 have dimension 0. It is\nshown that for every \\Delta^0_2-computable real number \\alpha in [0,1] there is\na \\Delta^0_2 sequence S such that \\dim(S) = \\alpha.\n  A discrete version of constructive dimension is also developed using\ntermgales, which are supergale-like functions that bet on the terminations of\n(finite, binary) strings as well as on their successive bits. This discrete\ndimension is used to assign each individual string w a dimension, which is a\nnonnegative real number dim(w). The dimension of a sequence is shown to be the\nlimit infimum of the dimensions of its prefixes.\n  The Kolmogorov complexity of a string is proven to be the product of its\nlength and its dimension. This gives a new characterization of algorithmic\ninformation and a new proof of Mayordomo's recent theorem stating that the\ndimension of a sequence is the limit infimum of the average Kolmogorov\ncomplexity of its first n bits.\n  Every sequence that is random relative to any computable sequence of\ncoin-toss biases that converge to a real number \\beta in (0,1) is shown to have\ndimension \\H(\\beta), the binary entropy of \\beta.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Mar 2002 20:28:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

These arrays act as photonic crystals\nthat may convert entangled photons into surface-plasmon waves, i.e.,\ncompressive charge density waves. We address the question whether the\nentanglement survives such a conversion. We find that, in principle, optical\nexcitation of the surface plasmon modes of a metal is a coherent process at the\nsingle-particle level. However, the quality of the plasmon-assisted\nentanglement is limited by spatial dispersion of the hole arrays. This spatial\ndispersion is due to the nonlocal dielectric response of a metal, which is\nparticularly large in the plasmonic regime; it introduces \"which way\" labels,\nthat may kill entanglement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2002 15:56:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
