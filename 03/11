In this paper we adopt the fundamental plane for ellipticals\nto estimate the central velocity dispersion and SMBH mass for a number of AGNs\nwith morphology parameters of their elliptical host galaxies obtained by the\nHST imaging observations. The estimated SMBH masses of 63 BL Lac objects, 10\nradio galaxies, 10 radio-loud quasars and 9 radio-quiet quasars are mostly in\nthe range of $10^{7.5} M_\\odot$ to $10^{9} M_\\odot$.

The\nEddington ratios of radio galaxies are substantially smaller than those of\nquasars. This suggests that the different observational features of radio-loud\nAGNs may be mainly dominated by accretion rate rather than by the black hole\nmass, which is in agreement with some evolutionary scenarios recently proposed\nfor radio-loud AGNs. Different from some previous claims, we found that the\nderived mean SMBH mass for radio-loud quasars is only slightly larger than that\nof radio-quiet quasars. Though their SMBH mass distributions are statistically\ndifferent, their Eddington ratio distributions are probably from the same\npopulation.

For material systems this is not\nsurprising since more often than not energetic considerations dictate that the\nground state or low lying excited states of many body system become ordered\ni.e. a collective variable, such as magnetization or the Fourier transform of\nthe density of a solid, picks up expectation values which otherwise would\nvanish by virtue of the dynamical symmetry(isotropy or translational symmetry\nin the aforementioned examples). More surprising was the discovery of the role\nof SBS in describing the vacuum or low lyng excitations of a quantum field\ntheory. First came spontaneously broken chiral symmetry which was then applied\nto soft pion physics. When combined with current algebra, this field dominated\nparticle physics in the 60's. Then came the application of the notion of SBS to\nsituations where the symmetry is locally implemented by gauge fields. In that\ncase the concept of order becomes more subtle. This development lead the way to\nelectroweak unification and it remains one of the principal tools of the\ntheorist in the quest for physics beyond the standard model. This brief review\nis intended to span the history of SBS with emphasis on conceptual rather than\nquantitative content. It is a written version of lectures of R.Brout on the\n``Paleolithic Age'' and on ``Modern Times'' by F.Englert, i.e. respectively\nwithout and with gauge fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2002 14:30:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Analysis of this process\nleads to a set of central requirements for candidate computing devices, in\naddition to the basic ones of stable qubits and controllable gates and\nmeasurements. The logical structure of the extraction process has a natural\ngeometry and hierarchy of communication needs; a computer whose physical\narchitecture is designed to reflect this will be able to tolerate the most\nnoise. The relevant networks are dominated by quantum information transport,\ntherefore to assess a computing device it is necessary to characterize its\nability to transport quantum information, in addition to assessing the\nperformance of conditional logic on nearest neighbours and the passive\nstability of the memory. The transport distances involved in QEC networks are\nestimated, and it is found that a device relying on swap operations for\ninformation transport must have those operations an order of magnitude more\nprecise than the controlled gates of a device which can transport information\nat low cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2002 15:34:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
