The dramatic breakdown of the operator\nproduct expansion at large Bjorken x due to the formation of a narrow jet with\ninvariant mass W (W^2=Q^2(1-x)/x) calls for an alternative approach. Our main\nconjecture is that the dominant contribution at each twist is the one which\nmixes under renormalization with the leading twist (ultraviolet dominance). At\ntwist two the dominant perturbative corrections at large x due to soft and\ncollinear radiation can be factorized into a jet function. From the ultraviolet\ndominance conjecture it follows that the twist two parton distribution as well\nas the jet function actually factorize to any order in the twist expansion.\nThis factorization suggests that non-perturbative corrections ~1/W^{2n}\nexponentiate together with the leading twist. We verify explicitly, at the\nlevel of a single dressed gluon, the cancellation between ambiguities due to\ninfrared renormalons in the twist-two coefficient functions and those due to\nthe ultraviolet divergence of twist-four matrix elements. Independently of the\nrenormalon analysis, we show that the dominant contribution to twist four at\nlarge x is associated with a twist-two like configuration: the final states are\nidentical to those of twist two, whereas the initial states differ just by\nadditional partons carrying small momentum fractions.

The first chapter is a pedagogical\nintroduction about supergravity theories. In the second chapter closed strings\nare analyzed, with particular emphasis on type IIB, whose orientifold\nprojection, in order to build type-I models, is the subject of the third\nchapter. Original results are reported in chapters 4 and 5. In chapter 4 we\ndescribe the complete coupling of (1,0) six-dimensional supergravity to tensor,\nvector and hypermultiplets. The generalized Green-Schwarz mechanism implies\nthat the resulting theory embodies factorized gauge and supersymmetry\nanomalies, to be disposed of by fermion loops. Consequently, the low-energy\ntheory is determined by the Wess-Zumino consistency conditions, rather than by\nthe requirement of supersymmetry, and this procedure does not fix a quartic\ncoupling for the gauginos. In chapter 5 we describe the low-energy effective\nactions for type-I models with brane supersymmetry breaking, resulting form the\nsimultaneous presence of supersymmetric bulks, with one or more gravitinos, and\nnon-supersymmetric combinations of BPS branes.The consistency of the resulting\ngravitino couplings implies that local supersymmetry is non-linearly realized\non some branes.

Using both its algebraic characterization and the Sullivan completion\napproach to phantom maps, we generalize some of the recent results of Le,\nMcGibbon and Strom. We particularly emphasize on the set of phantom maps with\ninfinite Gray index, describing it in an original algebraic way.\n  We furthermore introduce and study a natural filtration on SNT-sets (that is\nsets of homotopy types of spaces having the same n-type for all n), which\nappears to have the same algebraic characterization of the Gray one on phantom\nmaps. For spaces whose rational homotopy type is that of an H-space or a\nco-H-space, we establish criteria permitting to determinate those subsets of\nthis filtration which are non trivial, generalizing work of McGibbon and\nMoller.\n  We finally describe algebraically the natural connection between phantom maps\nand SNT-theory, associating to a phantom map its homotopy fiber or cofiber. We\nuse this description to show that this connection respect filtrations, and to\nfind generic examples of spaces for which the filtration on the corresponding\nSNT-set consists of infinitely many strict inclusions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Mar 2002 10:20:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

First, phenotypes\nof individuals with identical genotypes split into a few groups, according to\ninstability in the developmental dynamics that are triggered with the\ncompetitive interaction among individuals. Then, through mutational change of\ngenes, the phenotypic differences are fixed to genes, until the groups are\ncompletely separated in genes as well as phenotypes. It is also demonstrated\nthat the proposed theory leads to hybrid sterility under sexual recombination,\nand thus speciation is completed in the sense of reproductive isolation. As a\nresult of this post-mating isolation, the mating preference evolves later. When\nthere are two alleles, the correlation between alleles is formed, to\nconsolidate the speciation. When individuals are located in space, different\nspecies are later segregated spatially, implying that the speciation so far\nregarded to be allopatric may be a result of sympatric speciation.\nRelationships with previous theories, frequency-dependent selection,\nreinforcement, Baldwin's effect, phenotypic plasticity, and resource\ncompetition are briefly discussed.

This\nis allowed since, as it happens in every quantum theory for spin-1/2 particles,\nthe momentum operator (that is conserved) and the velocity operator (that is\nnot) are independent operators, which refer to independent quantities. As a\nconsequence, at variance with ordinary Dirac particles, for PT's the average\nvelocity is not equal to the classical velocity, but actually to the velocity\n\"dual\" of the classical velocity. The speed of PT's is therefore smaller than\nthe speed of light. Since a lot of experimental data seems to involve a\nnegative mass squared for neutrinos, we suggest that these particles might be\nPT's, travelling, because of their very small mass, at subluminal speeds very\nclose to c. The present theory is shown to be separately invariant under the C,\nP, T transformations; the covariance under Lorentz transformations is also\nproved. Furthermore, we derive the kinematical constraints linking 4-impulse,\n4-velocity and 4-polarization of free PT's\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Mar 2002 06:49:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
