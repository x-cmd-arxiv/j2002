For surface density exceeding about $10^{20}$ g\ncm$^{-2}$, which realizes when about a solar-mass material is contained within\na disk with a size of $\\sim 5 \\times 10^6$ cm, we find that (1) luminosity of\nphotons is practically zero due to significant photon trapping, (2) neutrino\ncooling dominates over advective cooling, (3) pressure of degenerate electrons\ndominates over pressure of gas and photons, and (4) magnetic field strength\nexceeds the critical value of about $4 \\times 10^{13}$ G, even if we take 0.1 %\nof the equi-partition value. The possible observable quantum electrodynamical\n(QED) effects arising from super-critical fields are discussed.

While this is a rigorous result of\nthe fluctuation--dissipation theorem for thermal equilibrium, it does not\nnecessarily apply to all types of turbulence. Building on previous work on\nrealizable Markovian closures, we explore a way to allow the decorrelation and\ndecay rates to differ (which in some cases affords a more accurate treatment of\neffects such as non-white noise), while retaining the computational advantages\nof a Markovian approximation. Some Markovian approximations differ only in the\ninitial transient phase, but the multiple-rate Markovian closure (MRMC)\npresented here could modify the steady-state spectra as well.

The high efficiency of the MC, that is small maximum\nweight or variance of the MC weight is achieved by means of dividing the\nintegration domain into small cells. The cells can be $n$-dimensional\nsimplices, hyperrectangles or Cartesian product of them. The grid of cells,\ncalled ``foam'', is produced in the process of the binary split of the cells.\nThe choice of the next cell to be divided and the position/direction of the\ndivision hyper-plane is driven by the algorithm which optimizes the ratio of\nthe maximum weight to the average weight or (optionally) the total variance.\nThe algorithm is able to deal, in principle, with an arbitrary pattern of the\nsingularities in the distribution. As any MC generator, it can also be used for\nthe MC integration. With the typical personal computer CPU, the program is able\nto perform adaptive integration/simulation at relatively small number of\ndimensions ($\\leq 16$).
