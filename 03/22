If the surrounding\nstellar cluster is as massive as the binary black hole, the torque acting on\nthe stars ejects a fraction which extracts all the binary's angular momentum on\nscales of ~10^7 yr, and a geometrically thick torus remains. In the present\narticle we show that a certain fraction of the stars has winds, shaped into\nelongated tails by the central radiation pressure, which are optically thick\nfor line of sights aligned with them. These stars are sufficiently numerous to\nachieve a covering factor of 1, so that the complete torus is optically thick.\nWe find the parameters of such a patchy torus to be in the right range to\nexplain the observed large column densities in AGN and their temporal\nvariations on time scales of about a decade. Within this model the BAL quasars\ncan be interpreted as quasars seen at intermediate inclination angles, with the\nline of sight grazing the edge of the torus. The opening angle of the torus is\nwider for major mergers and thus correlates with the central luminosity. In\nthis picture the spin of the merged black hole is possibly dominated by the\norbital angular momentum of the binary. Thus the spin of the merged black hole\npoints into a new direction, and consequently the jet experiences a spin-flip\naccording to the spin-paradigm. This re-orientation could be an explanation for\nthe X-shaped radio galaxies, and the advancing of a new jet through the ambient\nmedium for Compact Symmetric Objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Mar 2002 20:42:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Sep 2002 13:56:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

This method is perfectly\nsuitable for time-dependent 3D potentials where surfaces of sections and other\nsimple diagnostics are not applicable. We find that when halos are\ncentrally-concentrated most trajectories starting near the plane containing the\nbar become chaotic. Moreover, the shape of many of the remaining regular\ntrajectories do not match the bar density distribution, being too round.\nTherefore, time-independent self-consistent solutions are highly unlikely to be\nfound. When the non-rotating non-axisymmetric perturbation in the potential\nreaches 10%, almost all trajectories integrated are chaotic and have large\nLiapunov exponents. No regular trajectories aligned with the bar have been\nfound. Hence, if the evolution of the density figure is directly related to the\ncharacteristic timescale of orbital instability, bar dissolution would take\nplace on a timescale of few dynamical times. The slowly rotating\nnon-axisymmetric contribution to the potential required for the onset of\nwidespread chaotic behavior is remarkably small. Systems consisting of\ncentrally-concentrated axisymmetric halos and stellar bars thus appear to be\nstructurally unstable, and small (1%) deviations from perfect axisymmetry\nshould result in a bar dissolution on a timescale significantly smaller than\nthe Hubble time. Since halos found in CDM simulations of large scale structure\nare both centrally-concentrated and triaxial it is unlikely that stellar bars\nembedded in such halos would form and survive unless the halos are modified\nduring the formation of the baryonic component.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Mar 2002 21:12:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We have carried out a comprehensive number of time-dependent\nsimulations aimed at exploring the appearance of the instability. Our study has\nbeen performed using a fully relativistic hydrodynamics code. The general\nrelativistic hydrodynamic equations are formulated as a hyperbolic\nflux-conservative system and solved using a suitable Godunov-type scheme. We\nbuild a series of constant angular momentum discs around a Schwarzschild black\nhole. Furthermore, the self-gravity of the disc is neglected and the evolution\nof the central black hole is assumed to be that of a sequence of exact\nSchwarzschild black holes of varying mass. The black hole mass increase is thus\ndetermined by the mass accretion rate across the event horizon. In agreement\nwith previous studies based on stationary models, we find that by allowing the\nmass of the black hole to grow the disc becomes unstable.

The photonic crystal consisted of\ndielectric cylindrical rods in air placed normal to the basal plane on vertices\nof tiles composing the quasiperiodic pattern. An isotropic photonic band gap\n(PBG) appeared in the TM mode, where electric fields were parallel to the rods,\neven when the real part of a dielectric constant of the rod was as small as\n2.4. An isotropic PBG-like dip was seen in tiny Penrose and octagonal PCs with\nonly 6 and 9 rods, respectively. These results indicate that local multiple\nlight scattering within the tiny PC plays an important role in the PBG\nformation. Besides the isotropic PBG, we found dips depending on the incident\nangle of the light. This is the first report of anisotropic structures clearly\nobserved in transmission spectra of quasiperiodic PCs. Based on rod-number and\nrod-arrangement dependence, it is thought that the shapes and positions of the\nanisotropic dips are determined by global multiple light scattering covering\nthe whole system. In contrast to the isotropic PBG due to local light\nscattering, we could not find any PBGs due to global light scattering even\nthough we studied transmission spectra of a huge Penrose PC with 466 rods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Mar 2002 05:49:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
