Here we\ninvestigate the long-term period evolution, covering 340 years, going back to\nits discovery in AD 1662. Wavelets are used to determine both the period and\nsemi-amplitude. We show that the period decreased linearly between 1770 and\n1950; since 1950 the period has stabilized at 385 days. The semi-amplitude\nclosely follows the period evolution. Detailed analysis of the oldest data\nshows that before 1770 the period was about 495 days. We find no evidence for\nan increasing period during this time as found by Wood & Zarro. IRAS data shows\nthat the mass loss dropped dramatically around AD 1750. The decline agrees with\nthe mass-loss formalism from Vassiliadis & Wood, but is much larger than\npredicted by the Bloecker mass-loss law. An outer detached IRAS shell suggests\nthat R Hya has experienced such mass-loss interruptions before. The period\nevolution can be explained by a thermal pulse occuring around AD 1600, or by an\nnon-linear instability leading to an internal relaxation of the stellar\nstructure. The elapsed time between the mass-loss decline giving rise to the\nouter detached shell, and the recent event, of approximately 5000 yr suggests\nthat only one of these events could be due to a thermal pulse. Further\nmonitoring of R Hya is recommended, as both models make strong predictions for\nthe future period evolution. R Hya-type events, on time scales of 10^2-10^3 yr,\ncould provide part of the explanation for the rings seen around some AGB and\npost-AGB stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2002 10:08:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We find that the\ndistribution of mustar steadily skews toward larger values with increasing\ndistance from the cluster centre, converging to the field distribution at\ndistances greater than ~3 times the virial radius. A correlation between star\nformation rate and local projected density is also found, which is independent\nof cluster velocity dispersion and disappears at projected densities below ~1\ngalaxy (brighter than M_b=-19) per Mpc^2. This characteristic scale corresponds\napproximately to the mean density at the cluster virial radius. The same\ncorrelation holds for galaxies more than two virial radii from the cluster\ncentre. We conclude that environmental influences on galaxy properties are not\nrestricted to cluster cores, but are effective in all groups where the density\nexceeds this critical value. The present day abundance of such systems, and the\nstrong evolution of this abundance, makes it likely that hierarchical growth of\nstructure plays a significant role in decreasing the global average star\nformation rate. Finally, the low star formation rates well beyond the\nvirialised cluster rule out severe physical processes, such as ram pressure\nstripping of disk gas, as being completely responsible for the variations in\ngalaxy properties with environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2002 13:06:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Mar 2002 09:58:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-10"}

The band structure of the insulator\nhas been explicitly incorporated into the calculations as it affects\nionizations from the valence band. A Monte-Carlo model was constructed to\ndescribe the path of electrons following the impact of a single electron of\nenergy E 250 eV. The results show the evolution of the secondary electron\ncascades in terms of the number of electrons liberated, the spatial\ndistribution of these electrons, and the energy distribution among the\nelectrons as a function of time. The predicted ionization rates (5-13 electrons\nin 100 fs) lie within the limits given by experiments and phenomenological\nmodels. Calculation of the local electron density and the corresponding Debye\nlength shows that the latter is systematically larger than the radius of the\nelectron cloud. This means that the electron gas generated does not represent a\nplasma in a single impact cascade triggered by an electron of E 250 eV energy.\nThis is important as it justifies the independent-electron approximation used\nin the model. At 1 fs, the (average) spatial distribution of secondary\nelectrons is anisotropic with the electron cloud elongated in the direction of\nthe primary impact. The maximal radius of the cascade is about 50 A at this\ntime. As the system cools, energy is distributed more equally, and the spatial\ndistribution of the electron cloud becomes isotropic. At 90 fs maximal radius\nis about 150 A.

In our setup, the signal under investigation is mixed with\na squeezed probe in an interferometer and, at the output, one of the two modes\nis revealed through homodyne detection. The second beam is then\namplitude-modulated according to the outcome of the measurement, and finally\nsqueezed according to the transmittivity of the interferometer. Using strongly\nsqueezed or anti-squeezed probes respectively, one achieves either a projective\nmeasurement, i.e. homodyne statistics arbitrarily close to the intrinsic\nquadrature distribution of the signal, and conditional outputs approaching the\ncorresponding eigenstates, or fully non-destructive one, characterized by an\nalmost uniform homodyne statistics, and by an output state arbitrarily close to\nthe input signal. By varying the squeezing between these two extremes, or\nsimply by tuning the internal phase-shift of the interferometer, the whole set\nof intermediate cases can also be obtained. In particular, an optimal quantum\nnondemolition measurement of quadrature can be achieved, which minimizes the\ninformation gain versus state disturbance trade-off.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2002 18:13:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The scheme described here uses a single phase modulator and two\ndifferential delay elements in series at the transmitter that form an\ninterferometer when combined with a third differential delay element at the\nreceiver. The protocol is characterized by a high efficiency, reduced exposure\nto an attack by an eavesdropper, and higher sensitivity to such an attack when\ncompared to other QKD schemes. For example, the efficiency with which\ntransmitted data contribute to the private key is 3/4 compared with 1/4 for\nBB84 [2]. Moreover, an eavesdropper can aquire a maximum of 1/3 of the key\nwhich leads to an error probability in the private key of 1/3. This can be\ncompared to 1/2 and 1/4 for these same parameters in both BB84 and IWY. The\ncombination of these considerations should lead to increased range and key\ndistribution rate over present fiber-based QKD schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2002 00:48:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
