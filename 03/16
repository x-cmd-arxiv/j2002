If so, then dark halos will emit radio\nand gamma ray signals initiated by neutralino annihilation. A particularly\npromising place to look for these indicators is at the center of the local\ngroup dwarf spheroidal galaxy Draco, and recent measurements of the motion of\nits stars have revealed it to be an even better target for dark matter\ndetection than previously thought. We compute limits on WIMP properties for\nvarious models of Draco's dark matter halo. We find that if the halo is nearly\nisothermal, as the new measurements indicate, then current gamma ray flux\nlimits prohibit much of the neutralino parameter space. If Draco has a moderate\nmagnetic field, then current radio limits can rule out more of it. These\nresults are appreciably stronger than other current constraints, and so\nacquiring more detailed data on Draco's density profile becomes one of the most\npromising avenues for identifying dark matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 2002 20:33:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
