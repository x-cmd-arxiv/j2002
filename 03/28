The only new element is the inclusion of anisotropy in the energy flux\nfrom the pulsar in the theory. In the standard theory of relativistic winds,\nthe Lorentz factor of the particles in front of the shock that terminates the\npulsar relativistic wind depends on the polar angle as\n$\\gamma=\\gamma_0+\\gamma_m\\sin^2\\theta$, where $\\gamma_0 \\sim 200$ and $\\gamma_m\n\\sim 4.5\\times 10^6$. The plasma flow in the wind is isotropic. After the\npassage of the pulsar wind through the shock, the flow becomes subsonic with a\nroughly constant (over the plerion volume) pressure $P={1\\over 3}n\\epsilon$,\nwhere $n$ is the plasma particle density and $\\epsilon$ is the mean particle\nenergy. Since $\\epsilon \\sim \\gamma mc^2$, a low-density region filled with the\nmost energetic electrons is formed near the equator. A bright torus of\nsynchrotron radiation develops here. Jet-like regions are formed along the\npulsar rotation axis, where the particle density is almost four orders of\nmagnitude higher than that in the equatorial plane, because the particle energy\nthere is four orders of magnitude lower. The energy of these particles is too\nlow to produce detectable synchrotron radiation. However, these quasi-jets\nbecome comparable in brightness to the torus if additional particle\nacceleration takes place in the plerion.

We examine the connection between mean annual\nsolar irradiance, as reconstructed from sunspot and isotope records, and the\nclimate, as proxied by two Northern Hemisphere surface air temperature\nreconstructions. By applying wavelet transforms to these signals, we are able\nto analyze both the frequency content of each signal, and also the time\ndependence of that content. After computing wavelet transforms of the data, we\nperform correlation analyses on the wavelet transforms of irradiance and\ntemperature via two techniques: the Pearson's method and the conditional\nprobability method. We thus track the correlation between individual frequency\ncomponents of both signals as a function of time. A nonzero correlation between\nthe irradiance and temperature wavelet spectra requires a phase lag between the\ntwo data sets (i.e., terrestrial response to solar output is not\ninstantaneous). We search for the optimal phase lag that maximizes the\ncorrelation.

We explore\ntwo processes that break the self-similarity of galaxy clusters: systematic\nvariation in the dark matter halo concentration and energy injection into the\nintracluster gas, through their effects on the observed cluster properties.\nThree observed relations between cluster properties and temperature are\nemployed to constrain the model; mass, slope of gas density profile (beta) and\nluminosity. The slope of the mass-temperature relation is found to be\nreproduced by our model when the observed variation in concentration is\nincluded, raising the slope from the self-similar prediction of 1.5, to that of\nthe observed relation, ~ 2. Heating of the gas is observed to have little\neffect on the mass-temperature relation. The mean trend in the beta-temperature\nrelation is reproduced by energy injection of 0.5-0.75 keV per particle, while\nconcentration variation has only a small effect. Excess energies calculated for\nindividual systems from the beta-temperature relation suggest that the lowest\nmass systems may have excess energies that are biased to lower values by\nselection effects. The observed properties of the luminosity-temperature\nrelation are reproduced by the combined effects of excess energy and a trend in\nthe dark matter concentration. At high masses the observed variation in dark\nmatter concentration results a slope of ~ 2.7 compared to recent observations\nin the range 2.6-2.9, whilst the observed steepening in galaxy groups is\npredicted when heating of 0.5-0.75 keV per particle is included.

It is also related to the Morse theory of\nclosed 1-forms. Given a controlled 0-connected cohomology class on a manifold M\nwith n = dim M > 4 we can realize it by a closed 1-form which is Morse without\ncritical points of index 0, 1, n-1 and n. If n = dim M > 5 and the cohomology\nclass is controlled 1-connected we can approximately realize any chain complex\nD_* with the simple homotopy type of the Novikov complex and with D_i=0 for i <\n2 and i > n-2 as the Novikov complex of a closed 1-form.

The guns\ncreate polarization-entangled photon pairs on demand. One such source might be\na semiconducter quantum dot, which has the distinct advantage over parametric\ndown-conversion that the probability of creating a photon pair is close to one,\nwhile the probability of creating multiple pairs vanishes. The swapping and\npurifying components are implemented by polarizing beam splitters and\nprobabilistic optical CNOT gates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Mar 2002 23:07:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

A leaky cavity is designed via the insertion of a\ndispersive mirror into a larger ideal cavity (the reservoir). In the case of\nparametric resonance the rotating wave approximation allows for the\nconstruction of an effective Hamiltonian. The number of produced particles is\nthen calculated using response theory as well as a non-perturbative approach.\nIn addition we study the associated master equation and briefly discuss the\neffects of detuning. The exponential growth of the particle numbers and the\nstrong enhancement at finite temperatures found earlier for ideal cavities turn\nout to be essentially preserved.
