We conclude here that this result\nis unavoidable, unless the masses are strongly underestimated by reverberation\nstudies, which does not seem to be the case. There are three issues to the\nproblem: 1. Accretion proceeds at Eddington or super-Eddington rates through\nthick discs. Several consequences follow: an anti-correlation between the line\nwidths of the lines and the Eddington ratios, and a decrease of the Eddington\nratio with an increasing black hole mass. Extrapolated to all quasars, these\nresults imply that the amount of mass locked in massive black holes should be\nlarger than presently thought. 2. The optical luminosity is not produced\ndirectly by the gravitational release of energy, and super-Eddington rates are\nnot required. The optical luminosity has to be emitted by a dense and thick\nmedium located at large distances from the center (10$^3$ to $10^4$\ngravitational radii). It can be due to reprocessing of the X-ray photons from\nthe central source in a geometrically thin warped disc, or in dense \"blobs\"\nforming a geometrically thick system, which can be a part of the accretion flow\nor the basis of an outflow. 3.

We find CS31082-001 to be\nextremely rich in r-process elements, comparable in this respect only to the\nsimilarly metal-poor, but carbon-enriched, giant CS22892-052. As a result of\nthe extreme overabundance of the heaviest r-process elements, and negligible\nblending from CH and CN molecular lines, a reliable measurement is obtained of\nthe U II line at 386 nm, for the first time in a halo star, along with numerous\nlines of Th II, as well as lines of 25 other r-process elements.

Unlike pure pentacene, the functionalized derivatives\nare readily soluble in acetone, and can be evaporated or spin-cast as thin\nfilms for potential device applications. The electrical conductivity of the\nsingle crystal materials is noticeably sensitive to ambient light changes. The\npurpose, therefore, of the present study, is to determine the nature of the\nphoto-response in terms of carrier activation vs. heating effects, and also to\nmeasure the dependence of the photo-response on photon energy. We describe a\nnew method, involving the temperature dependent photo-response, which allows an\nunambiguous identification of the signature of heating effects in materials\nwith a thermally activated conductivity. We find strong evidence that the\nphoto-response in the materials investigated is predominantly a highly\nlocalized heating mechanism. Wavelength dependent studies of the photo-response\nreveal resonant features and cut-offs that indicate the photon energy\nabsorption is related to the electronic structure of the material.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Mar 2002 21:51:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We can then infer the rate of change of orbital energy and angular\nmomentum and thus the evolution of the orbit. The orbits are fully described by\na semi-latus rectum $p$ and an eccentricity $e$. We find that while, during the\ninspiral, $e$ decreases until shortly before the orbit reaches the separatrix\nof stable bound orbits (which is defined by $p_{s}(e)$), in many\nastrophysically relevant cases the eccentricity will still be significant in\nthe last stages of the inspiral.

The two values $p_{s}$, $p_{crit}$ (for\ngiven $e$) move closer to each other, in coordinate terms, as the black hole\nspin is increased, as they do also for fixed spin and increasing eccentricity.\nOf particular interest are moderate and high eccentricity orbits around rapidly\nspinning black holes, with $p(e) \\approx p_{s}(e)$.

This poses fundamental problems for string theory,\nsince a scattering matrix is not well defined in such Universes. In a previous\npaper we have presented a model, based on (non-equilibrium) non-critical\nstrings, which is characterized by eventual ``graceful'' exit from a de Sitter\nphase. The model is based on a type-0 string theory, involving D3 brane worlds,\nwhose initial quantum fluctuations induce the non criticality. We argue in this\narticle that this model is compatible with the current observations. A crucial\nr\\^ole for the correct ``phenomenology'' of the model is played by the relative\nmagnitude of the flux of the five form of the type 0 string to the size of five\nof the extra dimensions, transverse to the direction of the flux-field. We do\nnot claim, at this stage at least, that this model is a realistic physical\nmodel for the Universe, but we find it interesting that the model cannot be\nruled out immediately, at least on phenomenological grounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 2002 12:21:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

It is shown that the entropy difference between\nthat of the composite and its marginal density matrices may be of arbitrary\nsign except under special circumstances when conditional probability can be\ndefined appropriately. This ambiguity is a consequence of the fact that the\noverlap matrix elements of the eigenstates of the composite density matrix with\nthose of its marginal density matrices also play important roles in the\ndefinitions of probabilities and the associated entropies, along with their\nrespective eigenvalues. The general results are illustrated using pure and\nmixed state density matrices of two-qubit systems. Two classes of density\nmatrices are found for which the conditional probability can defined: (1)\ndensity matrices with commuting decompositions and (2) those which are\ndecohered in the representation where the density matrices of the marginals are\ndiagonal. The first class of states encompass those whose separability is\ncurrently understood as due to particular symmetries of the states. The second\nare a new class of states which are expected to be useful for understanding\nseparability. Examples of entropy functionals of these decohered states\nincluding the crucial isospectral case are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Mar 2002 18:41:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
