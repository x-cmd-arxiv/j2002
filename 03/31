When the deterministic system\nadmits a uniformly asymptotically stable slow manifold, we show that the sample\npaths of the stochastic system are concentrated in a neighbourhood of the slow\nmanifold, which we construct explicitly. Depending on the dynamics of the\nreduced system, the results cover time spans which can be exponentially long in\nthe noise intensity squared (that is, up to Kramers' time). We obtain\nexponentially small upper and lower bounds on the probability of exceptional\npaths. If the slow manifold contains bifurcation points, we show similar\nconcentration properties for the fast variables corresponding to\nnon-bifurcating modes. We also give conditions under which the system can be\napproximated by a lower-dimensional one, in which the fast variables contain\nonly bifurcating modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Mar 2002 22:16:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 14 Jun 2003 14:45:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In this article I sketch the beginnings of a\ntheory that would import these notions into the category of hedral sets in the\nsense of Morelli and the category of polyhedral sets in the sense of Schanuel.\nBoth of these theories can be viewed as extensions of the theory of finite sets\nand mappings between finite sets, with the concept of cardinality being\nreplaced by the more general notion of Euler measure (sometimes called\ncombinatorial Euler characteristic). I prove a ``functoriality'' theorem\n(Theorem 1) for subset-selection in the context of polyhedral sets, which\nprovides quasi-combinatorial interpretations of assertions such as $2^{-1} =\n\\frac12$ and ${1/2 \\choose 2} = -\\frac18$. Furthermore, the operation of\nforming a power set can be viewed as a special case of the operation of forming\nthe set of all mappings from one set to another; I conclude the article with a\npolyhedral analogue of the set of all mappings between two finite sets, and a\nrestrictive but suggestive result (Theorem 2) that offers a hint of what a\ngeneral theory of exponentiation in the polyhedral category might look like.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Mar 2002 22:44:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Apr 2002 04:10:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 31 Jul 2003 01:22:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
