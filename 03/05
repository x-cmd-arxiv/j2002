A period of 220 days (416 days in the near-infrared) is\ncovered from the first observation obtained a few days before maximum light.\nSpectroscopic observations are also discussed. Using as a distance calibrator\nthe Type Ia SN 2000E, which occurred some months later in the same galaxy, and\nfitting a blackbody law to the photometric data we obtain a maximum bolometric\nluminosity for SN 1999el of $\\sim 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$. In general, the\nphotometric properties of SN 1999el are very similar to those of SN 1998S, a\nbright and well studied Type IIn SN, showing a fast decline in all observed\nbands similar to those of Type II-L SNe. The differences with SN 1998S are\nanalyzed and ascribed to the differences in a pre-existing circumstellar\nenvelope in which dust was already present at the moment of the SN outburst. We\ninfer that light echoes may play a possibly significant role in affecting the\nobserved properties of the light curves, although improved theoretical models\nare needed to account for the data. We conclude that mass loss in the\nprogenitor RG stars is episodic and occurs in an asymmetric way. This implies\nthat collapsing massive stars appear as normal Type II SN if this occurs far\nfrom major mass loss episodes, whereas they appear as Type IIn SNe if a large\nmass loss episode is in progress.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 2002 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Our starting\npoint is the ``universal Hamiltonian''--valid in the g->oo limit--which\nincludes the charging energy, the single-electron energies (described by random\nmatrix theory), and the average exchange interaction. We then calculate the\nmagnitude of the most relevant finite g corrections, namely, the effect of\nsurface charge, the ``gate'' effect, and the fluctuation of the residual e-e\ninteraction. The resulting zero-temperature peak spacing distribution has\ncorrections of order Delta/sqrt(g). For typical values of the e-e interaction\n(r_s ~ 1) and simple geometries, theory does indeed predict an asymmetric\ndistribution with a significant even/odd effect. The width of the distribution\nis of order 0.3 Delta, and its dominant feature is a large peak for the odd\ncase, reminiscent of the delta-function in the g->oo limit. We consider finite\ntemperature effects next. Only after their inclusion is good agreement with the\nexperimental results obtained. Even relatively low temperature causes large\nmodifications in the peak spacing distribution: (a) its peak is dominated by\nthe even distribution at kT ~ 0.3 Delta (at lower T a double peak appears); (b)\nit becomes more symmetric; (c) the even/odd effect is considerably weaker; (d)\nthe delta-function is completely washed-out; and (e) fluctuation of the\ncoupling to the leads becomes relevant.
