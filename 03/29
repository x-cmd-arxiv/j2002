The orbiting satellite excites\ndensity enhancement as a wake, and the wake exerts a tidal force on the disk.\nBecause of the additional torque from the wakes in the halo, the amplitudes of\nthe induced warps are much larger than the classical estimate by [hunt1969],\nwho considered only the direct torque from the LMC. The obtained amplitudes of\nm=0, 1, 2 warps in the larger halo model show very good agreement with the\nobserved amplitude in the Milky Way.

The scaling\nexponents of the energy flux agree with those of the transverse velocity\nstructure functions through refined similarity hypothesis, consistent with\nKraichnan's prediction \\cite{Kr74}. The helicity flux is even more intermittent\nthan the energy flux and its scaling exponents are closer to those of the\npassive scalar. Using Waleffe's helical decomposition, we demonstrate that the\nexistence of positive mean helicity flux inhibits the energy transfer in the\nnegative helical modes, a non-passive effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Mar 2002 16:36:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
