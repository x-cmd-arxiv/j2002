The structure of stripped NFW halos depends mainly on the fraction of\nmass lost, and can be expressed in terms of a simple correction to the original\nNFW profile.

All\ninteractions within the restricted Hartree-Fock approach are analyzed and in\nprinciple can be taken into account. In particular, we have obtained the matrix\nelements for the exchange interactions of extended states and the crystal\nelectric field effects. In order to calculate the matrix elements of exchange\nfor extended states we first introduce an auxiliary potential and then\nintegrate it with an effective charge density corresponding to the electron\nexchange transition under consideration. The problem of finding the auxiliary\npotential is solved by using the strategy of the full potential LAPW approach,\nwhich is based on the general solution of periodic Poisson's equation. Here we\nuse an original technique for the general solution of periodic Poisson's\nequation and multipole expansions of electron densities. We apply the technique\nto obtain periodic potentials of the face centered cubic lattice and discuss\nits accuracy and convergence in comparison with other methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Mar 2002 10:15:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2002 11:31:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

The relevant\nflavor singlet axial current is anomalous, i.e., its divergence contains a\npiece which is the celebrated $U_A(1)$ anomaly. This anomaly is intimately\nassociated with the $\\eta^\\prime$ meson, which gets its mass from it. When the\ngauge degrees of freedom of QCD are confined within a volume as is presently\nunderstood, the $U_A(1)$ anomaly is known to induce color anomaly leading to\n\"leakage\" of the color out of the confined volume (or bag). For consistency of\nthe theory, this anomaly should be cancelled by a boundary term. This ``color\nboundary term\" inherits part or most of the dynamics of the volume (i.e., QCD).\nIn this thesis, we exploit this mapping of the volume to the surface via the\ncolor boundary condition to perform a complete analysis of the flavor singlet\naxial charge in the chiral bag model using the Cheshire Cat Principle. This\nenables us to obtain the hitherto missing piece in the axial charge associated\nwith the gluon Casimir effect.

The force is exerted between a silicon cantilever\ncoated with chromium and a similar rigid surface and is detected looking at the\nshifts induced in the cantilever frequency when the latter is approached. The\nscaling of the force with the distance between the surfaces was tested in the\n0.5 - 3.0 $\\mu$m range, and the related force coefficient was determined at the\n15% precision level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Mar 2002 10:54:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
