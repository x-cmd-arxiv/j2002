To this aim, a routine is constructed to\nderive the molecular concentrations through dissociation equilibrium\ncalculations, and estimate the opacities due to H2, H2O, OH, C2, CN, and CO for\nany given density, temperature, and chemical composition of the gas. Then,\nsynthetic TP-AGB models with dredge-up are calculated by either 1) adopting the\nnewly developed routine, or 2) interpolating between fixed opacity tables for\nsolar chemical composition, which is the usual prescription in AGB evolution\ncalculations. The comparison between the two cases shows that the change in the\ndominant opacity sources, as the C/O ratio grows from below to above unity,\ncrucially affects the evolution of the effective temperature, i.e. causing a\nnotable cooling of the carbon-rich models (with C/O>1).

We study radiation of electrons\naccelerated at such boundary layers as an option for standard approaches\ninvolving internal shocks in jets. The acceleration process in the boundary\nlayer yields in a natural way a two component electron distribution: a\npower-law continuum with a bump at the energy, where energy gains equal\nradiation losses, followed by a cut-off. For such distributions we derive the\nobserved spectra of synchrotron and inverse-Compton radiation, including\ncomptonization of synchrotron and CMB photons. Under simple assumptions of\nenergy equipartition between the relativistic particles and the magnetic field,\nthe relativistic jet velocity at large scales and a turbulent character of the\nshear layer, the considered radiation can substantially contribute to the jet\nradiative output. In the considered conditions the synchrotron emission is\ncharacterized by a spectral index of the radio-to-optical continuum being\napproximately constant along the jet. A characteristic feature of the obtained\nbroad-band synchrotron spectrum is an excess at X-ray frequencies, similar to\nthe one observed in some objects by Chandra. As compared to the uniform jet\nmodels, the velocity shear across the radiating boundary region leads to\ndecrease and frequency dependence of the observed jet-counterjet radio\nbrightness asymmetry.
