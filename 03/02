There are 500 unobserved GRBs for\neach observed one. The lack of a clear trigger makes it hard to detect these\nunobserved GRBs as orphan afterglows. At late time, hundreds or thousands of\nyears after a GRB, we expect to observe a GRB remnant (GRBR). These remnants\ncould be distinguished from the more frequent SNRs using their different\nmorphology. While SNRs are spherical, GRBRs that arise from a highly collimated\nflow, are expected to be initially nonspehrical. Using SPH simulations we\nfollow the evolution of a GRBR and calculate the image of the remnant produced\nby bremsstrahlung and by synchrotron emission.

The range of the\ninteraction is found to have a decisive effect both on the nature of the\nfield-induced instability of the ground state and on the properties of the\nsystem at energies above the corresponding gap. For a short-range repulsive\ninteraction, tunneling is dominated by the renormalization of the coupling\nconstant, which leads eventually to the charge-density wave instability. For a\nlong-range interaction, there exists an intermediate energy range in which the\nconductance obeys a power-law scaling form, similar to that of a 1D Luttinger\nliquid. The exponent is magnetic-field dependent, and more surprisingly, may be\npositive or negative, i. e., interactions may either suppress or enhance the\ntunneling conductance compared to its non-interacting value. At energies near\nthe gap, scaling breaks down and tunneling is again dominated by the\ninstability, which in this case is an (anisotropic) Wigner crystal instability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Mar 2002 00:20:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-10-30"}

When their squared masses are plotted against the\nintrinsic orbital angular momenta {\\rm L}, $\\Delta^*$'s with even and odd\nparity can be described by the same Regge trajectory. For a given {\\rm L},\nnucleon resonances with spin {\\rm S}=3/2 are approximately degenerate in mass\nwith $\\Delta$ resonances. To which total angular momentum {\\rm L} and {\\rm S}\ncouple has no significant impact on the baryon mass. Nucleons with spin 1/2 are\nshifted in mass; the shift is - in units of squared masses - proportional to\nthe component in the wave function which is antisymmetric in spin and flavor.\nBased on these observations, a new baryon mass formula is proposed which\nreproduces nearly all known baryon masses. It is shown that the masses are\ncompatible with a quark-diquark picture while the richness of the\nexperimentally known states require three particles to participate in the\ndynamics. This conflict is resolved by proposing that quarks polarize the QCD\ncondensates and are surrounded by a polarization cloud shielding the color. A\nnew interpretation of constituent quarks as colored quark clusters emerges;\ntheir interaction is responsible for the mass spectrum. Fast flavor exchange\nbetween the colored quark clusters exhausts the dynamical richness of the\nthree-particle dynamics. The colored-quark-cluster model provides a mechanism\nin which the linear confinement potential can be traced to the increase of the\nvolume in which the condensates are polarized. The quark-spin magnetic moment\ninduces currents in the polarized condensates which absorb the quark-spin\nangular momentum: the proton spin is not carried by quark spins.
