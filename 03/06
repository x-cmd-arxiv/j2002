In order to explore the\norigin of these subluminous stars, we evolved a set of low-mass stars from the\nmain sequence through the helium-core flash to the HB for a wide range in the\nmass loss along the red-giant branch (RGB). Stars with the largest mass loss\nevolve off the RGB to high effective temperatures before igniting helium in\ntheir cores. Our results indicate that the subluminous EHB stars, as well as\nthe gap within the EHB of NGC 2808, can be explained if these stars undergo a\nlate helium-core flash on the white-dwarf cooling curve. Under these conditions\nthe flash convection will penetrate into the stellar envelope, thereby mixing\nmost, if not all, of the envelope hydrogen into the hot helium- burning\ninterior. This phenomenon is analogous to the \"born-again\" scenario for\nproducing hydrogen-deficient stars during a very late helium-shell flash.\n\"Flash mixing\" greatly enhances the envelope helium and carbon abundances and,\nas a result, leads to an abrupt increase in the HB effective temperature. We\nargue that the EHB gap in NGC 2808 is caused by this theoretically predicted\ndichotomy in the HB morphology. Using new helium- and carbon-rich stellar\natmospheres, we show that the flash-mixed stars have the same reduced UV flux\nas the subluminous EHB stars.

We find that shock surfing/surftron acceleration\nproducing the suprathermal electrons occurs in the shock transition region\nwhere a series of large amplitude electrostatic solitary waves (ESWs) are\nexcited by Buneman instability under the interaction between the reflected ions\nand the incoming electrons. It is shown that the electrons are likely to be\ntrapped by ESWs, and during the trapping phase they can be effectively\naccelerated by the shock motional/convection electric field. We discuss that\nsuprathermal electrons can be accelerated up to $m_i c^2 (v_0/c)$, where $m_i\nc^2$ is the ion rest mass energy and $v_0$ is the shock upstream flow velocity.\nFurthermore, some of these suprathermal electrons may be effectively trapped\nfor infinitely long time when Alfv\\'en Mach number $M_A$ exceeds several 10,\nand they are accelerated up to the shock potential energy determined by the\nglobal shock size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Mar 2002 06:26:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

This detection method\ninvolves the filtering of the detector output with a set of theoretical\nwaveforms or templates. One of the most important factors in this strategy is\nknowing how many templates are needed in order to reduce the loss of possible\nsignals. In this study we calculate the number of templates and computational\npower needed for a one-step search for gravitational waves from inspiralling\nbinary systems. We build on previous works by firstly expanding the\npost-Newtonian waveforms to 2.5-PN order and secondly, for the first time,\ncalculating the number of templates needed when using P-approximant waveforms.\nThe analysis is carried out for the four main first-generation interferometers,\nLIGO, GEO600, VIRGO and TAMA. As well as template number, we also calculate the\ncomputational cost of generating banks of templates for filtering GW data. We\ncarry out the calculations for two initial conditions. In the first case we\nassume a minimum individual mass of $1 M_{\\odot}$ and in the second, we assume\na minimum individual mass of $5 M_{\\odot}$. We find that, in general, we need\nmore P-approximant templates to carry out a search than if we use standard PN\ntemplates. This increase varies according to the order of PN-approximation, but\ncan be as high as a factor of 3 and is explained by the smaller span of the\nP-approximant templates as we go to higher masses. The promising outcome is\nthat for 2-PN templates the increase is small and is outweighed by the known\nrobustness of the 2-PN P-approximant templates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Mar 2002 13:15:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We analyze this off-shellness in\nmodel-approaches to QCD, one of them enabling us to keep close contact to the\nrelated effect in QED.
