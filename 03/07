The code is based on a variable Eddington factor method to deal\nwith the integro-differential character of the Boltzmann equation. The moments\nof the neutrino distribution function and the energy and lepton number exchange\nwith the stellar medium are determined by iteratively solving the zeroth and\nfirst order moment equations in combination with a model Boltzmann equation.\nThe latter is discretized on a grid of tangent rays. The integration of the\ntransport equations and the neutrino source terms is performed in a\ntime-implicit way. In the present version of the program, the transport part is\ncoupled to an explicit hydrodynamics code which follows the evolution of the\nstellar plasma by a finite-volume method with piecewise parabolic\ninterpolation, using a Riemann solver for calculating the hydrodynamic states.\nThe neutrino source terms are implemented in an operator-split step. Neutrino\ntransport and hydrodynamics can be calculated with different spatial grids and\ndifferent time steppings. The structure of the described code is modular and\noffers a high degree of flexibility for an application to relativistic and\nmulti-dimensional problems at different levels of refinement and accuracy. We\ncritically evaluate results for a number of test cases, including neutrino\ntransport in rapidly moving stellar media and approximate relativistic core\ncollapse, and suggest a path for generalizing the code to be used in\nmulti-dimensional simulations of convection in neutron stars and supernovae.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2002 10:22:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2002 09:51:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The\npossibility of pairing arises due to some essential features of\nquasi-two-dimensional electronic structure of cuprates: (i) The Fermi contour\nwith strong nesting features; (ii) The presence of extended saddle point near\nthe Fermi level; (iii) The existence of some ordered state (for example,\nantiferromagnetic) close to the superconducting one as a reason for an\nappearing of \"pair\" Fermi contour resulting from carrier redistribution in\nmomentum space. In an extended vicinity of the saddle point, momentum space has\nhyperbolic (pseudoeuclidean) metrics, therefore, the principal values of\ntwo-dimensional reciprocal reduced effective mass tensor have unlike signs.\nRearrangement of holes in momentum space results in a rise of \"pair\" Fermi\ncontour which may be defined as zero-energy line for relative motion of the\npair. The superconducting gap arises just on this line. Pair Fermi contour\nformation inside the region of momentum space with hyperbolic metrics results\nin not only superconducting pairing but in a rise of quasi-stationary state in\nthe relative motion of the pair. Such a state has rather small decay and may be\nrelated to the pseudogap regime of underdoped cuprates. It is concluded that\nthe pairing in cuprates may be due to screened Coulomb repulsion. In this case,\nthe superconducting energy gap in hole-doped cuprates exists in the region of\nhole concentration which is bounded both above and below. The superconducting\nstate with positive condensation energy exists in more narrow range of doping\nlevel inside this region. Such hole concentration dependence correlates with\ntypical phase diagram of cuprates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Mar 2002 20:27:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The scissors modes built on spin-saturated ground and\nspin-polarized isomeric states are analyzed in virtue of both macroscopic\ncollective and microscopic shell-model treatments. It is shown that the mutual\ndestruction of Coulomb and the exchange-correlation parts of the residual\ninteraction makes the collective shift small and the net effect can depend on\ndetails of the actual excited state. The crosstalk with dipole and spin-dipole\nmodes is studied in detail. In particular, a strong crosstalk with spin-dipole\nnegative-parity mode is found in the case of spin-polarized states. Triaxiality\nand ionic structure considerably complicate the scissors response, mainly at\nexpense of stronger fragmentation of the strength. Nevertheless, even in these\ncomplicated cases the scissors mode is mainly determined by the global\ndeformation. The detailed ionic structure destroys the spherical symmetry and\ncan cause finite M1 response (transverse optical mode) even in clusters with\nzero global deformation. But its strength turns out to be much smaller than for\nthe genuine scissors modes in deformed systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2002 13:09:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

However the\ntransmission and processing of (quantum) information is a physical process in\nspacetime. Therefore such basic notions in quantum information theory as qubit,\nchannel, composite systems and entangled states should be formulated in space\nand time. In particlular we suggest that instead of a two level system (qubit)\nthe basic notion in a relativistic quantum information theory should be a\nnotion of an elementary quantum system, i.e. an infinite dimensional Hilbert\nspace $H$ invariant under an irreducible representation of the Poincare group\nlabeled by $[m,s]$ where $m\\geq 0$ is mass and $s=0,1/2,1,...$ is spin. We\nemphasize an importance of consideration of quantum information theory from the\npoint of view of quantum field theory. We point out and discuss a fundamental\nfact that in quantum field theory there is a statistical dependence between two\nregions in spacetime even if they are spacelike separated. A classical\nprobabilistic representation for a family of correlation functions in quantum\nfield theory is obtained. Entangled states in space and time are considered. It\nis shown that any reasonable state in relativistic quantum field theory becomes\ndisentangled (factorizable) at large spacelike distances if one makes local\nobservations. As a result a violation of Bell`s inequalities can be observed\nwithout inconsistency with principles of relativistic quantum theory only if\nthe distance between detectors is rather small. We suggest a further\nexperimental study of entangled states in spacetime by studying the dependence\nof the correlation functions on the distance between detectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Mar 2002 21:36:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The coherence here is determined by the relative phase\ninside a state. Unfortunately, so far all the relevant experimental results in\nquantum optics are insensitive to the phase information of the coherent state.\nLack of phase information may cause serious consequences in many problems in\nquantum optics. For example, an ensemble of two mode squeezed states is a\nclassical ensemble if the phase in each state is totally random; but it is a\nnon-classical ensemble if the phase in each state is fixed. As a timly\napplication, verification of this type of phase information in an ensemble of\ntwo mode squeezed states from the conventional laser is crucial to the validity\nof the continuous variavable quantum teleportation(CVQT) experiment. Here we\ngive a simple scheme to distinguish two different ensemble of states: the\nRudolph-Sanders ensemble, by which each squeezed states emitted has a uniform\ndistribution from $0-2\\pi$ on the phase value; and the van Enk-Fuchs ensemble,\nwhich emmits identical states with a fixed(but unknown) phase for every state.\nWe believe our proposal can help to give a clear picture on whether the\nexisting two mode squeezed states so far are indeed non-classical states which\ncan be used as the entanglement resource.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2002 08:12:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 10 Mar 2002 14:33:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2002 08:19:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
