For variations in initial disk density of a factor of 16,\nvariations of stellar dipole strength of a factor of 4, and for various initial\nconditions with respect to the disk truncation radius and the existence of a\ndisk field, outflows with similar morphologies were consistently produced.\nSecondly, the system is self-regulating, where the outflow properties depend\nrelatively weakly on the parameters above. The large scale magnetic field\nstructure rapidly evolves to a configuration that removes angular momentum from\nthe disk at a rate that depends most strongly on the field and weakly on the\nrotation rate of the foot-points of the field in the disk and the mass outflow\nrate. Third, the simulated jets are episodic, with the timescale of jet\noutbursts identical to the timescale of magnetically induced oscillations of\nthe inner edge of the disk. To better understand the physics controlling these\ndisk oscillations, we present a semi-analytical model and confirm that the\noscillation period is set by the spin down rate of the disk inner edge.\nFinally, our simulations offer strong evidence that it is indeed the\ninteraction of the stellar magnetosphere with the disk, rather than some\nprimordial field in the disk itself, that is responsible for the formation of\njets from these systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Mar 2002 01:03:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The relevant transition operators are\nconstructed utilizing a variety of mechanisms present in current gauge\ntheories, with emphasis on the intermediate neutrinos, both light and heavy,\nand heavy SUSY particles.
