Especially, the photon-trapping effects\nare appreciable even below L ~ L_E, while they appear above ~ 3L_E according to\nthe slim disk. Through the photon-trapping effects, the luminosity is reduced\nand the effective temperature profile becomes flatter than r^{-3/4} as in the\nstandard disk. In the case that the viscous heating is effective only around\nthe equatorial plane, the luminosity is kept around the Eddington luminosity\neven at very large mass accretion rate, Mdot>>L_E/c^2. The effective\ntemperature profile is almost flat, and the maximum temperature decreases in\naccordance with rise in the mass accretion rate. Thus, the most luminous radius\nshifts to the outer region when Mdot/(L_E/c^2) >> 10^2. In the case that the\nenergy is dissipated equally at any heights, the resultant luminosity is\nsomewhat larger than in the former case, but the energy-conversion efficiency\nstill decreases with increase of the mass accretion rate, as well. The most\nluminous radius stays around the inner edge of the disk in the latter case.\nHence, the effective temperature profile is sensitive to the vertical\ndistribution of energy production rates, so is the spectral shape. Future\nobservations of high L/L_E objects will be able to test our model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Mar 2002 07:41:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Effects from the initial-state interaction are fully taken into\naccount. A comparison of the influence of the Delta exchange on the considered\nannihilation channels is made and reveals that its importance for three-pion\nannihilation is strongly reduced as compared to two-pion annihilation. It is\nfound that annihilation into three uncorrelated pions can yield up to 10 % of\nthe total experimentally observed three-pion annihilation cross section.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Mar 2002 10:30:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In spite of major advances\nin the understanding of polymer science, the protein problem has remained\nlargely unsolved. Here, we show that a polymer chain viewed as a tube not only\ncaptures the well-known characteristics of polymers and their phases but also\nprovides a natural explanation for many of the key features of protein\nbehavior. There are two natural length scales associated with a tube subject to\ncompaction -- the thickness of the tube and the range of the attractive\ninteractions. For short tubes, when these length scales become comparable, one\nobtains marginally compact structures, which are relatively few in number\ncompared to those in the generic compact phase of polymers. The motifs\nassociated with the structures in this new phase include helices, hairpins and\nsheets. We suggest that Nature has selected this phase for the structures of\nproteins because of its many advantages including the few candidate strucures,\nthe ability to squeeze the water out from the hydrophobic core and the\nflexibility and versatility associated with being marginally compact. Our\nresults provide a framework for understanding the common features of all\nproteins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Mar 2002 14:09:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

A self-adjoint extension is fixed by\nchoosing the spectral parameter $\\epsilon$ of the associated eigenvalue\nequation equal to zero. The spectral problem is discussed in the context of\nthree different representations. For $\\epsilon =0$, the eigenvalue equation is\nexactly solved in all these representations, in which square-integrable\nsolutions are explicity found. A set of constants of motion corresponding to\nthese quantum models is also obtained. Furthermore, the algebraic structure\nunderlying the quantum models is explored.
