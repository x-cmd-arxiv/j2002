We find that the\nhost galaxy of GRB 000926 is an extended, strong Ly-alpha emitter with a\nrest-frame equivalent width of 71+20-15 AA. The galaxy consists of two main\ncomponents and several fainter knots. GRB 000926 occurred in the western\ncomponent, whereas most of the Ly-alpha luminosity (about 65%) originates in\nthe eastern component. Using archival HST images of the host galaxy we measure\nthe spectral slopes (f_lambda prop. to lambda^beta) of the two components to\nbeta = -2.4+-0.3 (east) and -1.4+-0.2 (west). This implies that both components\ncontain at most small amounts of dust, consistent with the observed strong\nLy-alpha emission. The western component has a slightly redder V-I colour than\nthe eastern component, suggesting the presence of at least some dust. We do not\ndetect the host galaxy of GRB 000301C in neither Ly-alpha emission nor in U and\nI-band images. We infer a limit of U(AB)>27.7 (2-sigma limit per arcsec^2).

Two\nother similarly complex objects with many narrow troughs show broad MgII\nabsorption extending longward of their systemic host galaxy redshifts. This can\nbe explained as absorption of an extended continuum source by the\nrotation-dominated base of a disk wind. Five other objects have absorption\nwhich removes an unprecedented ~90% of all flux shortward of MgII. The\nabsorption in one of them has varied across the ultraviolet with an amplitude\nand rate of change as great as ever seen. This same object may also show broad\nH-beta absorption. Numerous reddened BAL quasars have been found, including at\nleast one reddened mini-BAL quasar with very strong FeII emission. The five\nreddest objects have continuum reddenings of E(B-V)~0.5, and in two of them we\nfind strong evidence that the reddening curve is even steeper than that of the\nSMC. We have found at least one object with absorption from FeIII but not FeII.\nThis may be due to a high column density of moderately high-ionization gas, but\nthe FeIII level populations must also be affected by some sort of resonance.\nFinally, we have found two luminous, probably reddened high-redshift objects\nwhich may be BAL quasars whose troughs partially cover different regions of the\ncontinuum source as a function of velocity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 2002 15:37:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-05"}

Given a subset A of the dual space X* denote by\n$A_{(1)}$ the weak* sequential closure of A, i.e., the set of all limits of\nweak*-convergent sequences in A.\n  The study of weak* sequential closures of linear subspaces of the duals of\nseparable Banach spaces was initiated by S.Banach. The first results of this\nstudy were presented in the appendix to his book \"Theorie des operations\nlineaires\" (1932).\n  It is natural to suppose that the reason for studying weak* sequential\nclosures by S. Banach and S. Mazurkiewicz was the lack of acquaintance of S.\nBanach and his school with concepts of general topology. Although the name\n\"General topology\" was introduced later, the subject did already existed. F.\nHausdorff introduced topological spaces in his book published in 1914,\nAlexandroff-Urysohn (1924) studied compactness, and A.Tychonoff published his\ntheorem on compactness of products in 1929. Also J.von Neumann introduced the\nnotion of a weak topology in his paper published in 1929.\n  Using the notions of a topological space and the Tychonoff theorem, more\nelegant treatment of weak and weak* topologies, and the duality of Banach\nspaces was developed by L.Alaoglu, N.Bourbaki and S.Kakutani (1938-1940).\n  Nevertheless, an \"old-fashioned\" treatment of S.Banach still attracts\nattention. It happens because the \"sequential\" approach is very useful in\nseveral contexts.\n  The main purpose of the paper is to describe the history of this direction of\nresearch and to give an up-to-date (1999) survey of the results on weak*\nsequential closures and their applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2002 19:27:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
