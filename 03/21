The emission is caused by\nradiative shocks created where the supernova blast wave strikes dense gas\nprotruding inward from the equatorial ring. We measure and tabulate line\nidentifications, fluxes and, in some cases, line widths and shifts. We compute\nflux correction factors to account for substantial interstellar line absorption\nof several emission lines. Nebular analysis shows that optical emission lines\ncome from a region of cool (T_e ~ 10^4 K) and dense (n_e ~ 10^6 cm^-3) gas in\nthe compressed photoionized layer behind the radiative shock. The observed line\nwidths indicate that only shocks with shock velocities V_s < 250 km/s have\nbecome radiative, while line ratios indicate that much of the emission must\nhave come from yet slower (V_s < 135 k/ms) shocks. We are able to fit the UV\nfluxes with an idealized radiative shock model consisting of two shocks (V_s =\n135 and 250 km/s). The observed UV flux increase with time can be explained by\nthe increase in shock surface areas as the blast wave overtakes more of the\nprotrusion. The observed flux ratios of optical to highly-ionized UV lines are\ngreater by a factor of ~ 2 -- 3 than predictions from the radiative shock\nmodels and we discuss the possible causes. We also present models for the\nobserved H-alpha line widths and profiles, which suggests that a chaotic flow\nexists in the photoionized regions of these shocks.

The 1.35 mm (250 mum rest wavelength)\ncontinuum flux density is 7.5+-1.3 mJy, in agreement with previous bolometer\nmeasurements at 1.2 mm with the 30-m IRAM telescope. The 3mm (580 mum rest\nwavelength) continuum is not detected with a 3 sigma upper limit of 0.7mJy. We\nalso report observations of the 450 mum continuum in PSS2322+1944 using the\nSCUBA array at the JCMT. The quasar was detected with a 450 mum flux density of\n79+-19mJy. At the angular resolution of 4.8\" x 2.1\" at 1.3mm and 6.2\" x 4.9\" at\n3.2 mm, the interferometer observations do not show evidence of spatial\nextension in the continuum or CO line emission. Assuming no gravitational\nmagnification, we estimate a molecular gas mass of ~2.5x10^11 M_sun. The\nmolecular gas is warm (40-100 K) and dense (10^3.5-10^4.1 cm^-3). The\ninfrared-to-CO luminosity ratio is ~185 L_sun/(K km/s pc^2), comparable to the\nvalues found for ultraluminous infrared galaxies. The detection of CO emission\nin this high redshift QSO provides further evidence that the radio emission and\nthe millimeter to submillimeter continuum emission are predominantly powered by\na starburst which is coeval with the AGN activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2002 22:57:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Our method is based on cutting the path into pieces of an\nappropriately scaled length, controlling the interaction between the different\npieces, and applying an invariance principle to the single pieces. In this way\nwe show that the self-repellent random walk large deviation rate function for\nthe empirical drift of the path converges to the self-repellent Brownian motion\nlarge deviation rate function after appropriate scaling with the interaction\nparameters. The method is considerably simpler than the approach followed in\nour earlier work, which was based on functional analytic arguments applied to\nvariational representations and only worked in a very limited number of\nsituations.\n  We consider two examples of a weak interaction limit: (1) vanishing\nself-repellence, (2) diverging step variance.

Moreover, we show that these scaling\nresults are stable against adding self-attraction, provided the self-repellence\ndominates. In example (2), we prove a conjecture by Aldous for the scaling of\nself-avoiding walk with diverging step variance. Moreover, we consider\nself-avoiding walk on a two-dimensional horizontal strip such that the steps in\nthe vertical direction are uniform over the width of the strip and find the\nscaling as the width tends to infinity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2002 18:30:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The shape\nof the memory is the vector of sizes of these qudits, which may differ. We\ndetermine when N copies of a quantum memory A embed in N(1+o(1)) copies of\nanother quantum memory B. This relationship captures the notion that B is as at\nleast as useful as A for all purposes in the bulk limit. We show that the\nembeddings exist if and only if for all p >= 1, the p-norm of the shape of A\ndoes not exceed the p-norm of the shape of B. The log of the p-norm of the\nshape of A can be interpreted as the maximum of S(\\rho) + H(\\rho)/p (quantum\nentropy plus discounted classical entropy) taken over all mixed states \\rho on\nA. We also establish a noiseless coding theorem that justifies these entropies.\nThe noiseless coding theorem and the bulk embedding theorem together say that\neither A blindly bulk-encodes into B with perfect fidelity, or A admits a state\nthat does not visibly bulk-encode into B with high fidelity.\n  In conclusion, the utility of a hybrid quantum memory is determined by its\nsimultaneous capacity for classical and quantum entropy, which is not a finite\nlist of numbers, but rather a convex region in the classical-quantum entropy\nplane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Mar 2002 01:08:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 May 2002 02:41:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 29 Jan 2003 06:55:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-16"}
