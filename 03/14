Microlensing is common in multiply imaged sources.

In this regime, which is\nrealized in the interstellar medium, some accretion disks, protogalaxies,\ngalaxy-cluster gas, early Universe, etc., magnetic fluctuations can be excited\nat scales below the viscous cutoff. The salient feature of the resulting\nsmall-scale magnetic turbulence is the folded structure of the fields. It is\ncharacterized by very rapid transverse spatial oscillation of the field\ndirection, while the field lines remain largely unbent up to the scale of the\nflow. Quantitatively, the fluctuation level and the field-line geometry can be\nstudied in terms of the statistics of the field strength and of the field-line\ncurvature. In the kinematic limit, the distribution of the field strength is an\nexpanding lognormal, while that of the field-line curvature K is stationary and\nhas a power tail K^{-13/7}. The field strength and curvature are\nanticorrelated, i.e. the growing fields are mostly flat, while the sharply\ncurved fields remain relatively weak. The field, therefore, settles into a\nreduced-tension state. Numerical simulations demonstrate three essential\nfeatures of the nonlinear regime. First, the total magnetic energy is equal to\nthe total kinetic energy. Second, the intermittency is partially suppressed\ncompared to the kinematic case, as the fields become more volume-filling and\ntheir distribution develops an exponential tail.

We perform our calculations both in\nthe time and frequency domain. In order to numerically solve the infinite\nsystem of coupled equations, we truncate it at some value $l_{\\rm max}$.\nAlthough the time dependent equations can be numerically evolved without any\nproblems, the eigenvalue equations possess a singular structure, which is\nrelated to the existence of a continuous spectrum. This prevents the numerical\ncomputation of an eigenmode if its eigenfrequency falls inside the continuous\nspectrum. The properties of the latter depend strongly on the cut-off value\n$l_{\\rm max}$ and it can consist of several either disconnected or overlapping\npatches, which are the broader the more relativistic the stellar model is. By\ndiscussing the dependence of the continuous spectrum as a function of both the\ncut-off value $l_{\\rm max}$ and the compactness $M/R$, we demonstrate how it\naffects the inertial modes. Through the time evolutions we are able to show\nthat some of the inertial modes can actually exist inside the continuous\nspectrum, but some cannot. For more compact and therefore more relativistic\nstellar models, the width of the continuous spectrum strongly increases and as\na consequence, some of the inertial modes, which exist in less relativistic\nstars, disappear.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2002 15:46:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
