The amplitude ratio and the measured difference in gravitational\nredshift is used to estimate the masses of the individual components: 0.55Msol\nand 0.71Msol. Hence the total mass of the HE 1414-0848 system is 1.26Msol, only\n10% below the Chandrasekhar limit. The results of a model atmosphere analysis\nare consistent with our mass estimated from the orbit. Temperatures of the\nindividual components are also determined. Possible scenarios for the formation\nof this system are discussed. The system will merge due to loss of angular\nmomentum via gravitational wave radiation after two Hubble times.

After compactifying this truncated model\non a two-torus and switching off the U(1) vector fields of this theory, we\nrecall a formulation of the resulting three-dimensional action as a double\nErnst system coupled to gravity. Further, by applying the so-called normalized\nHarrison transformation on a generic solution of this double Ernst system we\nrecover the U(1) vector field sector of the theory. Afterward, we compute the\nfield content of the generated charged configuration for the special case when\nthe starting Ernst potentials correspond to a pair of interacting Kerr black\nholes, obtaining in this way an exact field configuration of the 5D\nEinstein-Maxwell-Kalb-Ramond theory endowed with effective Coulomb and dipole\nterms with momenta.
