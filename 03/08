We model the\nactual magnetic field as the sum of global dipolar and star-centered multipolar\nfields. In configurations involving axially symmetric and uniform multipolar\nfields, 'neutral points' and 'neutral lines' exist close to the stellar\nsurface. Also, the curvature radii of magnetic field lines near the stellar\nsurface can never be smaller than the stellar radius, even for very high order\nmultipoles. Consequently, such configurations are unable to provide an\nefficient pair creation process above pulsar polar caps, necessary for plasma\nmechanisms of generation of pulsar radiation. In configurations involving\naxially symmetric and non-uniform multipoles, the periphery of the pulsar polar\ncap becomes fragmented into symmetrically distributed narrow sub-regions where\ncurvature radii of complex magnetic field lines are less than the radius of the\nstar. The pair production process is only possible just above these\n'favourable' sub-regions. As a result, the pair plasma flow is confined within\nnarrow filaments regularly distributed around the margin of the open magnetic\nflux tube. Such a magnetic topology allows us to model the system of twenty\nisolated sub-beams observed in PSR B0943+10 by Deshpande & Rankin (1999, 2001).\nWe suggest a physical mechanism for the generation of pulsar radio emission in\nthe ensemble of finite sub-beams, based on specific instabilities.
