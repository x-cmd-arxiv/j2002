It has been suggested that M32 may be a tidally\ndisturbed r^(1/4) elliptical galaxy, or the remnant bulge of a disk-stripped\nearly-type spiral galaxy. This paper reveals that the surface brightness\nprofile, the velocity dispersion measurements, and the estimated supermassive\nblack hole mass in M32 are inconsistent with the galaxy having, and probably\never having had, an r^(1/4) light profile. Instead, the radial surface\nbrightness distribution of M32 resembles an almost perfect (bulge + exponential\ndisk) profile, which is accompanied by a marked increase in the ellipticity\nprofile and an associated change in the position angle profile where the `disk'\nstarts to dominate. Compelling evidence that this bulge/disk interpretation is\naccurate comes from the best-fitting r^(1/n) bulge model which has a Sersic\nindex n=1.5, in agreement with the recently discovered relation between a\nbulge's Sersic index and the mass of its supermassive black hole. An index n>4\nwould also be inconsistent with the stellar velocity dispersion of M32. The\nbulge-to-disk size ratio r_e /h equals 0.20, and the logarithm of the\nbulge-to-disk luminosity ratio log(B/D) equals 0.22, typical of lenticular\ngalaxies. The effective radius of the bulge is 27\" (~100 pc), while the\nscale-length of the disk is less well determined: due to possible tidal-\nstripping of the outer profile beyond 220-250\", the scale-length may be as\nlarge as 1.3 kpc. M32 is a relatively face-on, nucleated, dwarf galaxy with a\nlow surface brightness disk and a high surface brightness bulge.

It is\nshown that a two band model provides a consistent interpretation of the\ntemperature dependence of the normal state resistance and the Hall constant.\nWhereas band structure calculations suggest an increase in T_c upon partial\nsubstitution of Ni with Fe and Co, Co substitution quenches superconductivity\nand Fe substitution leads to an increase followed by a decrease in T_c. The\nobserved variation of T_c may be explained in terms of a competition between\nincrease in T_c due to increase in density of states and a decrease due to spin\nfluctuations. Based on these results, it is suggested that the spin\nfluctuations are weaker in Fe doped samples as compared to the Co doped ones.\nAn initial decrease in T_c (and the normal state resistance) followed by an\nincrease is observed on application of pressure. The decrease in T_c for small\napplied pressures can be understood in terms of the decrease in the density of\nstates at the Fermi level. The subsequent increase in T_c with pressure is due\nto a lattice softening or a structural phase transition, consistent with the\nband structure calculations. It is conjectured that suppression of spin\nfluctuations by pressure may also be responsible for the observed increase in\nT_c at higher pressures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Feb 2002 12:11:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The symmetrical setup of linear optical elements\nconsists of four beam splitters, four polarization beam splitters and four\nmirrors. A photon EPR-pair and two single photons are required as the input\nmodes. The projection on the W-state can be made by a four-photon coincidence\nmeasurement. Further, we show that by means of a horizontally oriented\npolarizer in front of one detector the W-state of three photons can be\ngenerated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Feb 2002 12:31:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Aug 2002 06:22:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
