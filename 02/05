Motivated by the empirical lognormal model\nthat characterizes the probability distribution function(PDF) of the\nthree-dimensional mass distribution excellently, we critically investigate the\nvalidity of lognormal model in the weak lensing statistics. Assuming that the\nconvergence field, $\\kappa$, is approximately described by the lognormal\ndistribution, we present analytic formulae of convergence for the one-point PDF\nand the Minkowski functionals. Comparing those predictions with ray-tracing\nsimulations in various cold dark matter models, we find that the one-point\nlognormal PDF can describe the non-Gaussian tails of convergence fields\naccurately up to $\\nu\\sim10$, where $\\nu$ is the level threshold given by\n$\\nu\\equiv\\kappa/\\var^{1/2}$, although the systematic deviation from lognormal\nprediction becomes manifest at higher source redshift and larger smoothing\nscales. The lognormal formulae for Minkowski functionals also fit to the\nsimulation results when the source redshift is low. Accuracy of the\nlognormal-fit remains good even at the small angular scales, where the\nperturbation formulae by Edgeworth expansion break down. On the other hand,\nlognormal models does not provide an accurate prediction for the statistics\nsensitive to the rare events such as the skewness and the kurtosis of\nconvergence. We therefore conclude that the empirical lognormal model of the\nconvergence field is safely applicable as a useful cosmological tool, as long\nas we are concerned with the non-Gaussianity of $\\nu\\simlt5$ for low source\nredshift samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2002 03:18:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Numerical simulations of a turbulent mixing layer are performed\nusing both a second order, and a fourth order accurate finite volume\ndiscretization. The Leray model emerges as the most accurate, robust and\ncomputationally efficient among the three LES-$\\alpha$ subgrid\nparameterizations for the turbulent mixing layer. The evolution of the resolved\nkinetic energy is analyzed and the various subgrid-model contributions to it\nare identified. By comparing LES-$\\alpha$ at different subgrid resolutions, an\nimpression of finite volume discretization error dynamics is obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2002 09:43:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
