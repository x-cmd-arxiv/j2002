The proof is based\non a central limit theorem for ordered joint distributions together with a\ncommutator estimate related to the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion. The\nresult can be considered a generalization of Johansson's theorem on the\nlimiting distribution of the shape of a random word in a fixed alphabet as its\nlength goes to infinity [math.CO/9906120,math.PR/9909104].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Feb 2002 23:45:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-16"}

It is shown that if the polynomial variables q\nand t of the Lawrence-Krammer representation are chosen to be appropriate\nalgebraically independant unit complex numbers, then the form is\nnegative-definite Hermitian. Since unitary matrices diagonalize, the conjugacy\nclass of a matrix in the unitary group is determined by its eigenvalues. It is\nshown that the eigenvalues of a Lawrence-Krammer matrix satisfy some symmetry\nrelations. Using the fact that non-invertible knots exist, the symmetry\nrelations imply that there are matrices in the image of the Lawrence-Krammer\nrepresentation that are conjugate in the unitary group, yet the braids that\nthey correspond to are not conjugate. The two primary tools involved in\nconstructing the form are Bigelow's interpretation of the Lawrence-Krammer\nrepresentation, together with Morse theory on manifolds with corners.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Feb 2002 22:40:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2002 18:50:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2005 19:41:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
