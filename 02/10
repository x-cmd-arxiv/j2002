Using McKee & Williams' (1997) distribution of birthrates for OB\nassociations in the Galaxy, we determine the expected behavior of the\ntime-dependent FUV field for random positions in the local ISM.

Due to attenuation\nby dust, only associations within about 500 pc contribute significantly to the\nenergy density at a given point. The FUV field is asymmetric at a given point,\nand the asymmetry grows for higher fields. The FUV field fluctuates with a\nvariety of amplitudes, the larger ones being less frequent. The mean field is\nabout twice the median field because of these fluctuations, or spikes, in the\nradiation field. These spikes, which last $\\sim 30$ Myr, are caused by the\ninfrequent birth of nearby associations. We also model shorter duration spikes\ncaused by runaway OB stars.

Once discovered, further study of a\nSN and its possible use as an astronomical tool (e.g., as a distance estimator)\nrequire knowledge of the SN type. Current classification methods rely almost\nsolely on the analysis of SN spectra to determine their type. However,\nspectroscopy may not be possible or practical when SNe are faint, numerous, or\ndiscovered in archival studies. We present a classification method for SNe\nbased on the comparison of their observed colors with synthetic ones,\ncalculated from a large database of multi-epoch optical spectra of nearby\nevents. We discuss the capabilities and limitations of this method. For\nexample, type Ia SNe at redshifts z < 0.1 can be distinguished from most other\nSN types during the first few weeks of their evolution, based on V-R vs. R-I\ncolors. Type II-P SNe have distinct (very red) colors at late (t > 100 days)\nstages. Broadband photometry through standard Johnson-Cousins $UBVRI$ filters\ncan be useful to classify SNe out to z ~ 0.6. The use of Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey (SDSS) ugriz filters allows the extension of our classification method\nto even higher redshifts (z = 0.75), and the use of infrared bands, to z = 2.5.\nWe demonstrate the application of this method to a recently discovered SN from\nthe SDSS.
