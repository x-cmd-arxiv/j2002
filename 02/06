The central star remains invisible at L' and\nM'. Several clumpy regions in the north lobe dominate in L' and M' luminosity.\nIn particular a pointlike source (peak A) at 0\".5 northeast of the center of\nthe nebula exhibits the highest surface brightness with a very red spectral\nenergy distribution (SED).

The\nresulting mean-field theory is valid in arbitrary dimensions and able to\ndescribe the low-temperature crossover between three, two and one-dimensional\nBose gases. When applied to a degenerate two-dimensional atomic hydrogen gas,\nwe obtain a reduction of the three-body recombination rate which compares\nfavorably with experiment. Supplementing the mean-field theory with a\nrenormalization-group approach to treat the critical fluctuations, we also\nincorporate into the theory the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition that occurs in a\nhomogeneous Bose gas in two dimensions. In particular, we calculate the\ncritical conditions for the Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition as a function\nof the microscopic parameters of the theory. The proposed theory is further\napplied to a trapped one-dimensional Bose gas, where we find good agreement\nwith exact numerical results obtained by solving a nonlinear Langevin field\nequation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Feb 2002 11:39:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-13"}

The physical observables in the far-zone of the source are\ndescribed by a specific set of radiative multipole moments. By matching the\nexterior solution to the metric of the post-Newtonian source in the near-zone\nwe obtain the explicit expressions of the source multipole moments.

In other\nwords, a hierarchy exists between the self energy of the monopole and the\ntemperature of the confinement-deconfinement phase transition. The ratio of the\ntwo scales is no less than a factor of 10. Moreover, we argue that the\nhierarchy scale can well eventually extend to a few hundred GeV on the\nultraviolet side. The corresponding phenomenology is discussed, mostly within\nthe polymer picture of the monopole condensation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2002 16:53:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The field dependence of $\\mu$ is quite complicate. In\nparticular, at intermediate values of the field, there appears to be a\ncrossover between two different electric--field dependent behaviors of $\\mu.$\nThe electric field strength at crossover is well correlated with the\nconcentration of CH$_{4}.$ This fact suggests that different excitations of the\nmolecular solute might be involved in the momentum-- and energy--transfer\nprocesses for different values of the mean electron energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Feb 2002 15:28:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
