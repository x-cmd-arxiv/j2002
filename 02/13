In the oblate DMH, satellites on polar orbits have the longest survival\ntime, whereas satellites on coplanar prograde orbits are destroyed most\nrapidly.

The well-known Coincidence\nProblem studies the coincidence set C={x:f(x)=g(x)}. The number m=dimX-dimY is\ncalled the codimension of the problem. More general is the Preimage Problem.\nFor a map f:X->Z and a submanifold Y of Z, it studies the preimage set\nC={x:f(x) in Y}, and the codimension is m=dimX+dimY-dimZ. In case of\ncodimension 0, the classical Nielsen number N(f,Y) is a lower estimate of the\nnumber of points in C changing under homotopies of f, and for an arbitrary\ncodimension, of the number of components of C. We extend this theory to take\ninto account other topological characteristics of C. The goal is to find a\n\"lower estimate\" of the bordism group Omega_{p}(C) of C. The answer is the\nNielsen group S_{p}(f,Y) defined as follows. In the classical definition the\nNielsen equivalence of points of C based on paths is replaced with an\nequivalence of singular submanifolds of C based on bordisms. We let\nS_{p}^{prime}(f,Y) be the quotient group of Omega_{p}(C) with respect to this\nequivalence relation, then the Nielsen group of order p is the part of this\ngroup preserved under homotopies of f.

Liquid-state NMR\ntechniques on homonuclear spin systems are used to demonstrate the accuracy of\nthese gates both in simulation and experiment. Simulations of the coherent\nevolution of a 3-qubit system show that the control sequences faithfully\nimplement the unitary operations, typically yielding gate fidelities on the\norder of 0.999 and, for some sequences, up to 0.9997. The experimentally\ndetermined density matrices resulting from the application of different control\nsequences on a 3-spin system have overlaps of up to 0.99 with the expected\nstates, confirming the quality of the experimental implementation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Feb 2002 16:02:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

In this way, good approximations are\nobtained for the ground state both for the eigenfunction and the eigenvalue for\nproblems like the quartic oscillator, the one-dimensional Coulomb potential\nhaving a not normalizable ground state solution and for the one-dimensional\nKramers-Henneberger potential. We keep a coupling constant in the potential and\ntake it running with a generic cut-off that goes to infinity. The solution of\nthe Callan-Symanzik equation for the coupling constant generates the harmonic\noscillator Hamiltonian describing the behavior of the model at very small\ndistances (ultraviolet behavior). This approach, although algorithmic in its\nvery nature, does not appear to have a simple extension to obtain excited state\nbehavior. Rather, it appears as a straightforward non-perturbative method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Feb 2002 20:52:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-12"}

For intermediate driving\nstrengths we find a sudden change in the photon statistics of the light emitted\nfrom the cavity. Photon antibunching switches to photon bunching over a very\nnarrow range of intracavity photon number. It is proven that this sudden change\nin photon statistics occurs due to the existence of robust quantum interference\nof transitions between the dressed states of the atom-cavity system.\nFurthermore, it is shown that the strong photon bunching is a nonclassical\neffect for certain values of driving field strength, violating classical\ninequalities for field correlations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Feb 2002 03:52:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-16"}
