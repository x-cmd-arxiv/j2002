By analyzing\nColour-Colour (CC) and Colour-Magnitude Diagrams (CMD) we infer a reddening\n$E_{B-V}= 0.55\\pm0.10$, a distance of $3600 \\pm 400$ pc, and an age of about 2\nGyr. Synthetic CMDs performed with these parameters (but fixing $E_{B-V}=0.60$\nand $[{\\rm Fe/H}]=-0.60$), and including binaries, field contamination, and\nphotometric errors, allow a good description of the observed CMD. The elongated\nshape of the clump of red giants in the CMD is interpreted as resulting from a\ndifferential reddening of about $\\Delta E_{B-V}=0.06$ across the cluster, in\nthe direction perpendicular to the Galactic plane. NGC 2158 turns out to be an\nintermediate-age open cluster with an anomalously low metal content. The\ncombination of these parameters together with the analysis of the cluster\norbit, suggests that the cluster belongs to the old thin disk population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2002 11:19:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

These two\ncomponents of NMR spectra are related to 1:1 Sc/Nb ordered and compositionally\ndisordered regions of the crystal, respectively. It was shown that in the\ndisordered regions Sc^3+, Nb^5+ and O^2- ions are shifted from their cubic\nlattice sites at one of three possible directions: <100>, <110> or <111>. In\nPMN the NMR spectrum of 93Nb contains practically only the broad component. The\nportion of unbroadened spectrum that may correspond to ideal 1:2 regions\naccounts only for 1-2 percent of the total integral intensity. No evidance was\nobtained about existence of the 1:1 regions in PMN. The NMR data demonstrate\nthat in PMN the cubic symmetry at T > T_0 is locally broken due to ions shifts\nsimilar to that in disordered PSN. The values of the ion shifts were estimated\nin the point charges point dipoles approximation of the electric field\ngradients calculation both in the PSN and PMN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jan 2002 16:32:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2002 09:50:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Dynamical equations for the\ngravitational field are set up and an exact solution is found for the exterior\npart. Besides, equations of motion applying to inertial test particles moving\nin the exterior gravitational field are set up. By construction, the\ngravitational field of the system is not static with respect to the cosmic\nexpansion. This means that the radius of the source increases and that\ndistances between circular orbits of inertial test particles increase according\nto the Hubble law. Moreover, it is shown that if this model of an expanding\ngravitational field is taken to represent the gravitational field of the Sun\n(or isolated planetary systems), this has no serious consequences for\nobservational aspects of planetary motion. On the contrary some observational\nfacts of the Earth-Moon system are naturally explained within the QMF.

The basic idea was to generalize the old matrix model\napproach, replacing the simple matrix integrals by the four dimensional matrix\npath integrals of N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, and the Kazakov\ncritical points by the Argyres-Douglas critical points. In the present paper,\nwe study qualitatively similar toy path integrals corresponding to the two\ndimensional N=2 supersymmetric non-linear sigma model with target space CP^n\nand twisted mass terms. This theory has some very strong similarities with N=2\nsuper Yang-Mills, including the presence of critical points in the vicinity of\nwhich the large n expansion is IR divergent.

The latter converts the light energy into a\nsequence of electrical pulses corresponding to photo-detection events. It was\npredicted in 1984 on the basis of Quantum Optics and verified experimentally\nshortly thereafter that when the pump is non-fluctuating the emitted light does\nnot fluctuate much. Precisely, this means that the variance of the number of\nphoto-detection events observed over a sufficiently long period of time is much\nsmaller than the average number of events. Light having that property is said\nto be ``sub-Poissonian''. The theory presented rests on the concept introduced\nby Einstein around 1905, asserting that matter may exchange energy with a wave\nat angular frequency $\\omega$ only by multiples of $\\hbar\\omega$. The optical\nfield energy may only vary by integral multiples of $\\hbar\\omega$ as a result\nof matter quantization and conservation of energy. A number of important\nresults relating to isolated optical cavities containing two-level atoms are\nfirst established on the basis of the laws of Statistical Mechanics. Next, the\nlaser system with a pump and an absorber of radiation is treated. The\nexpression of the photo-current spectral density found in that manner coincides\nwith the Quantum Optics result.

Two separate sets of experiments\nwere performed. In a full QFT, the periodicity were validated with state\ntomography and fidelity measurements. For a simplified QFT, the three-qubit\npseudo-pure state was created by introducting an additional observer spin, and\nthe spectra recorded on the observer spin showed intuitively the power of QFT\\\nto find the periodicity. Experimentally realizing the QFT provides a critical\nstep to implement the renowned Shor's quantum factoring algorithm and many\nother algorithms. Moveover, it can be applied to the study of quantum chaos and\nother quantum information processing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2002 13:27:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
