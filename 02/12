Here we decompose blobs into objects known in graph theory as\n3-blocks. A 3-block is a graph that cannot be separated into disconnected\nsubgraphs by cutting the graph at 2 or fewer vertices. Clusters, blobs, and\n3-blocks are special cases of $k$-blocks with $k=1$, 2, and 3, respectively. We\nstudy bond percolation clusters at the percolation threshold on 2-dimensional\nsquare lattices and 3-dimensional cubic lattices and, using Monte-Carlo\nsimulations, determine the distribution of the sizes of the 3-blocks into which\nthe blobs are decomposed. We find that the 3-blocks have fractal dimension\n$d_3=1.2\\pm 0.1$ in 2D and $1.15\\pm 0.1$ in 3D. These fractal dimensions are\nsignificantly smaller than the fractal dimensions of the blobs, making possible\nmore efficient calculation of percolation properties. Additionally, the\ncloseness of the estimated values for $d_3$ in 2D and 3D is consistent with the\npossibility that $d_3$ is dimension independent. Generalizing the concept of\nthe backbone, we introduce the concept of a ``$k$-bone'', which is the set of\nall points in a percolation system connected to $k$ disjoint terminal points\n(or sets of disjoint terminal points) by $k$ disjoint paths. We argue that the\nfractal dimension of a $k$-bone is equal to the fractal dimension of\n$k$-blocks, allowing us to discuss the relation between the fractal dimension\nof $k$-blocks and recent work on path crossing probabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Feb 2002 14:23:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

When\nconsidering a system whose output is to be kept small (i.e. an error output),\nthe notion of input to output stability (IOS) arises. Alternatively, when\nconsidering a system whose output is meant to provide information about the\nstate (i.e. a measurement output), one arrives at the detectability notion of\noutput to state stability (OSS). Combining these concepts, one may consider a\nsystem with two outputs, an error and a measurement. This leads naturally to a\nnotion of partial detectability we call measurement to error stability (MES).\nThis property characterizes systems in which the error signal is detectable\nthrough the measurement signal.\n  This paper provides a partial Lyapunov characterization of the MES property.\nA closely related property of stability in three measures (SIT) is introduced,\nwhich characterizes systems for which the error decays whenever it dominates\nthe measurement.
