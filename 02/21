It is shown that the maximal (von\nNeumann) capacity of such a channel can be realized by a simple symbol by\nsymbol detector followed by a classical error correcting decoder.\n  For an intensity limited optical channel capacity is achieved by on-off\nkeying (OOK). The capacity per unit cost is shown to be 1 nat/photon = 1.44\nbit/photon, slightly larger than the 1 bit/photon obtained by orthogonal\nquantum signals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Feb 2002 10:34:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Sep 2002 13:30:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In the first part of the paper we determine the value of\nthe greatest cross norm for Werner states, for isotropic states and for Bell\ndiagonal states. In the second part we show that the greatest cross norm\ncriterion induces a novel computable separability criterion for bipartite\nsystems. This new criterion is a necessary but in general not a sufficient\ncriterion for separability. It is shown, however, that for all pure states, for\nBell diagonal states, for Werner states in dimension d=2 and for isotropic\nstates in arbitrary dimensions the new criterion is necessary and sufficient.\nMoreover, it is shown that for Werner states in higher dimensions (d greater\nthan 2), the new criterion is only necessary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Feb 2002 15:44:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-05"}
