Yet a meaningful (i.e. experimentally verified) version of the\ninteraction is one where the interaction is viewed from frame $\\Sigma'$.

These interactions\nare concentrated at discrete Lindblad and corotation resonances. Interactions\nat principal Lindblad resonances cause the planet's orbit to migrate and open a\ngap in the disk if the planet is sufficiently massive. Those at first order\nLindblad and corotation resonances change the planet's orbital eccentricity.\nEccentricity is excited by interactions at external Lindblad resonances which\nare located on the opposite side of corotation from the planet, and damped by\nco-orbital Lindblad resonances which overlap the planet's orbit. If the planet\nclears a gap in the disk, the rate of eccentricity damping by co-orbital\nLindblad resonances is reduced. Density gradients associated with the gap\nactivate eccentricity damping by corotation resonances at a rate which\ninitially marginally exceeds that of eccentricity excitation by external\nLindblad resonances. But the corotation torque drives a mass flux which reduces\nthe density gradient near the resonance. Sufficient partial saturation of\ncorotation resonances can tip the balance in favor of eccentricity excitation.\nA minimal initial eccentricity of a few percent is required to overcome viscous\ndiffusion which acts to unsaturate corotation resonances by reestablishing the\nlarge scale density gradient. Thus eccentricity growth is a finite amplitude\ninstability. Formally, interactions at the apsidal resonance, which is a\nspecial kind of co-orbital Lindblad resonance, appears to damp eccentricity\nfaster than external Lindblad resonances can excite it. However, apsidal waves\nhave such long wavelengths that they do not propagate in protoplanetary disks.\nThis reduces eccentricity damping by the apsidal resonance to a modest level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2002 19:31:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-21"}

We find, in agreement\nwith previous theoretical work, that the presence of the main morphological\ncomponents of galaxies--disks, spheroids, bars--is regulated by the mode of gas\naccretion and intimately linked to discrete accretion events. In the case we\npresent, disks arise from the smooth deposition of cooled gas at the center of\ndark halos, spheroids result from the stirring of preexisting disks during\nmergers, and bars are triggered by tides generated by satellites. This\ndemonstrates that morphology is a transient phenomenon within the lifetime of a\ngalaxy and that the Hubble sequence reflects the varied accretion histories of\ngalaxies in hierarchical formation scenarios. In particular, we demonstrate\ndirectly that disk/bulge systems can be built and rebuilt by the smooth\naccretion of gas onto the remnant of a major merger and that the present-day\nremnants of late dissipative mergers between disks are spheroidal stellar\nsystems with structure resembling that of field ellipticals.

Measurements of isotopic ratios in planetary nebulae probe\nmaterial which escapes the star to be further processed by future generations\nof stars.\n  We have measured the carbon isotopic abundance ratio, 12C/13C, in 11\nplanetary nebulae (PNe) by observing the J=2-->1 and J=3-->2 millimeter\ntransitions of 12CO and 13CO in molecular clouds associated with the PNe. A\nlarge velocity gradient (LVG) model has been used to determine the physical\nconditions for each PNe where both transitions have been detected. We detect\nboth 12CO and 13CO in 9 PNe. If 12CO/13CO = 12C/13C, the range of 12C/13C is\n2.2--31. Our results support theories which include some form of extra mixing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2002 21:35:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

However, since the disc shrinks rapidly once a cooling wave has\nstarted, the eccentricity should stop shortly after the end of a superoutburst.\nThis result disagrees with the suggestion by Hellier that decoupling the\nthermal and tidal instability in the TTI model can account for late superhumps\nand echo outbursts in ultra-low mass ratio systems. We propose instead that ER\nUMa short supercycles can be explained either by the alternation of narrow and\nwide outbursts similar to those occurring in SS Cyg, or by the effects of\nirradiation (Hameury et al. 2000). In both cases, we predict that superhumps\nshould be permanent, which is suggested by observations (Gao et al. 1999).

At the same time, its spectra require two (1.0 keV and\n0.2 keV) plasma components; the emission of the 0.2 keV plasma is stronger in\nthe region near the shell than the center. These results can be explained by a\nsimple model that IC 443 has a hot (1.0 keV) interior surrounded by a cool (0.2\nkeV) outer shell. From the emission measures, we infer that the 0.2 keV plasma\nis denser than the 1.0 keV plasma, suggesting pressure equilibrium between the\ntwo. In addition, we found that the ionization temperature of sulfur, obtained\nfrom H-like K$\\alpha$ to He-like K$\\alpha$ intensity ratio, is 1.5 keV,\nsignificantly higher than the gas temperature of 1.0 keV suggested from the\ncontinuum spectrum. The same can be concluded for silicon. Neither an\nadditional, hotter plasma component nor a multi-temperature plasma successfully\naccounts for this ratio, and we conclude that the 1.0 keV plasma is\noverionized. This is the first time that overionized gas has been detected in a\nSNR. For the gas to become overionized in the absence of a photoionizing flux,\nit must cool faster than the ions recombine. Thermal conduction from the 1.0\nkeV plasma to the 0.2 keV one could cause the 1.0 keV plasma to become\noverionized, which is plausible within an old (3$\\times10^4$ yr) SNR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Feb 2002 14:34:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

It is shown that there exist sets of measurements which can be used to\nprove three-particle entanglement, but which are nevertheless useless at\nproving three-particle nonlocality. In particular, it is shown that the quantum\npredictions giving a maximal violation of Mermin's three-particle Bell\ninequality [Phys. Rev.

The main thrust\nof the paper is an attempt to explore the ramifications for cryptographic\nsecurity of incorporating physics into our thinking at every level. I begin by\ndiscussing two fundamental cryptographic principles, namely that security must\nnot rely on secrecy of the protocol and that our local environment must be\nsecure, from a physical perspective. I go on to explain why by definition a\nparticular cryptographic task, oblivious transfer, is inconsistent with a\nbelief in the validity of quantum mechanics. More precisely, oblivious transfer\ndefines states and operations that do not exist in any (complex) Hilbert space.\nI go on to argue the fallaciousness of a \"black box\" approach to quantum\ncryptography, in which classical cryptographers just trust physicists to\nprovide them with secure quantum cryptographic sub-protocols, which they then\nattempt to incorporate into larger cryptographic systems. Lest quantum\ncryptographers begin to feel too smug, I discuss the fact that current\nimplementations of quantum key distribution are only technologically secure,\nand not \"unconditionally\" secure as is sometimes claimed. I next examine the\nconcept of a secure lab from a physical perspective, and end by making some\nobservations about the cryptographic significance of the (often overlooked)\nnecessity for parties who wish to communicate having established physical\nreference frames.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2002 20:37:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
