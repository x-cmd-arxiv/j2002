In contrast with Sazonov, who infers strong effects only\nin cases where the ratio of plasma frequency to cyclotron frequency is much\nlarger than the square of the characteristic electron Lorentz factor, nu_p/nu_B\n>> gamma^2, we find strong effects also for 1 << nu_p/nu_B << gamma^2.

Radiation from this region could\naccelerate the outflowing matter but radiation pressure should also slow it\ndown. We show that the radiation drag restricts the flow from attaining a very\nhigh velocity. We introduce the concept of an `equilibrium velocity' ($v_{eq}\n\\sim 0.5c$) which sets the upper limit of the terminal velocity achieved by a\ncold plasma due to radiation deposition force in the absence of gravity. If the\ninjection energy is $E_{in}$, then we find that the terminal velocity\n$v_\\infty$ satisfies a relation $v_\\infty^2 \\lsim v_{eq}^2 + 2 E_{in}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Feb 2002 13:06:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The\n\"basins of attraction\" that constitute the landscape features in configuration\nspace represent a distinct class of microstates of the system. So far only the\nmicrostates that are related to structural relaxation and viscosity have been\nconsidered in this paradigm.

In these, a distinct class of fluctuations exists, the\nfluctuations in concentration. The mean square amplitudes of these fluctuations\nrelate to the chemical activity coefficients [2], and their rise and decay\ntimes may be much longer than those of the density fluctuations - from which\nthey may be statistically independent. Here we provide data on the character of\nchemical order fluctuations in viscous liquids and on their relation to the\nenthalpy fluctuations that determine the structural relaxation time, and hence\nthe glass temperature Tg. Using a spectroscopically active chemical order\nprobe, we identify a \"chemical fictive temperature\", Tchm, by analogy with the\nfamiliar \"fictive temperature\" Tf (the cooling Tg).

Similarly, quantization sends\npo(0|2n-1) into q(2^{n-1}) and the above procedure makes Casimir operators for\nq(2^{n-1}) into same for po(0|2n-1).\n  Casimir operators for the Lie superalgebra vect(0|m) of vector fields on\npurely odd superspace are only constants for m>2. Conjecturally, same is true\nfor the Lie superalgebra svect(0|m) of divergence free vector fields, and its\ndeform, for m>3.\n  Invariant polynomials on po(0|2n-1) are also described. They do not\ncorrespond to Casimir operators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Feb 2002 18:37:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In order to achieve our\ngoal we give a model of detection which is fully local but departs from quantum\ntheory. In our model the zeropoint (vacuum) level of radiation lies below a\nthreshold of the detectors and only signals above the threshold are detectable.\nThe predictions of the model agree with those of quantum mechanics if the\nsignal intensities surpase some level and the efficiency is low. This is\nconsistent with the known fact that quantum mechanics is compatible with local\nrealism in that case (a fact called the ``efficiency loophole''). Our model\ngives a number of constraints which do not follow from the quantum theory of\ndetection and are experimentally testable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Feb 2002 10:11:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
