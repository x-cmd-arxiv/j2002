In the weak nonhermiticity limit we show\nthat the spectral correlations in the bulk of the spectrum display critical\nstatistics: the asymptotic linear behavior of the number variance is already\napproached for energy differences of the order of the eigenvalue spacing. To\nlowest order, its slope does not depend on the degree of nonhermiticity. Close\nthe edge, the spectral correlations are similar to the Hermitian case. In the\nstrong nonhermiticity limit the crossover behavior from the Ginibre ensemble to\nthe Poisson ensemble first appears close to the surface of the spectrum. Our\nmodel may be relevant for the description of the spectral correlations of an\nopen disordered system close to an Anderson transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Feb 2002 23:22:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

For fractional\nfilling factors nu=1/3 and 2/5 of the first Landau level, fractional charges\nq=e/3 and e/5, respectively, were measured. We investigate here the interaction\nof e/3 quasiparticles with a strong backscatterer and find unexpected results.\nWhen a weak backscatterer is introduced in the path of an otherwise noiseless\ncurrent of quasiparticles, stochastic partitioning of the quasiparticles takes\nplace and shot noise proportional to their charge appears. Specifically, at\nnu=1/3, noise corresponding to q=e/3 appears. However, the measured charge\nincreases monotonically as backscattering becomes stronger, approaching\nasymptotically q=e. In other words, only electrons, or alternatively, three\nbunched quasiparticles, tunnel through high potential barriers when impinged by\na noiseless current of quasiparticles. Here we show that such bunching of\nquasiparticles by a strong backscatterer depends on the average occupation\n(dilution) of the impinging quasiparticle current. For a very dilute impinging\ncurrent, bunching ceases altogether and the transferred charge approaches\nq=e/3. These surprising results prove that a sparse beam of quasiparticles,\neach with charge e/3, tunnel through high potential barriers, originally\nthought to be opaque for them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Feb 2002 01:43:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The book begins with a brief review of\nrelativity, relativistic quantum mechanics and classical gauge theories, with\nthe emphasis on the basic physical concepts and the mathematical foundations.\nThe external field problem and Klein's paradox are discussed and then resolved\nby introducing the so-called fermionic projector, a global object in space-time\nwhich generalizes the notion of the Dirac sea. The mathematical core of the\nbook is to give a precise definition of the fermionic projector and to employ\nmethods of hyperbolic differential equations for its detailed analysis. The\nfermionic projector makes it possible to formulate a new type of variational\nprinciples in space-time. The mathematical tools for the analysis of the\ncorresponding Euler-Lagrange equations are developed. A particular variational\nprinciple is proposed which gives rise to an effective interaction showing many\nsimilarities to the interactions of the standard model.\n  The main chapters of the book are easily accessible for beginning graduate\nstudents in mathematics or physics.

We show that this fact is in general not true\nfor linear operators. To remedy the situation, we introduce the new concept of\nmartingale subtype and show, that it is equivalent, also in the operator case,\nto the existence of an equivalent uniformly convex norm on X. In the case of\nidentity maps it is also equivalent to having martingale type p for some p>1.\n  Our main method is to use sequences of ideal norms defined on the class of\nall linear operators and to study the factorization of the finite summation\noperators.
