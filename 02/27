Considering these cold clouds instead of hot homogeneous gas as the\nmain baryonic component of proto-galactic halos may affect several issues\nduring galaxy formation. In particular, the baryonic matter loses angular\nmomentum through dynamical friction on the dark matter halo. In numerical\nsimulations using hot gas for baryonic matter, this gives rise to the so-called\nangular momentum problem. In this work, we study the dynamical friction exerted\non cold fractal gas by a collisionless background (dark matter) through\nhigh-resolution numerical simulations. First, we find that, for values of the\nparameters relevant during galaxy formation, the friction does not alter the\nmorphology of the fractal, which is mainly driven by internal dynamics. Then,\nwe show that the presence of substructures and inhomogeneities in a body has\nlittle effect on the global value of the friction. Parameters such as branching\nratio and fractal dimension also have little effect. In fact, we find out that\nthe main effect comes from the deformations and fluctuations of the fractal\nstructure in cold gas clumps. If the deformation time is of the same order of\nmagnitude or shorter than the typical build-up time of the friction, the\nfriction is weakened. We argue that this effect is relevant for galaxy\nformation, and that the angular momentum problem should not be worsened by\nincluding the small scale inhomogeneities of the cold gas which occur at a\nresolution out of reach of present simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2002 12:35:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We discuss the appearance of the ``Brazil nut''\neffect (where large particles move up) and the ``reverse Brazil nut'' effects\nin the stationary states reached by ``tap'' dynamics. In particular, we show\nthat the stationary state depends only on two thermodynamical quantities: the\ngravitational energy of the first and of the second species and not on the\nsample history. To describe the properties of the system, we generalize\nEdwards' approach by introducing a canonical distribution characterized by two\nconfigurational temperatures, conjugate to the energies of the two species.\nThis is supported by Monte Carlo calculations showing that the average of\nseveral quantities over the tap dynamics and over such distribution coincide.\nThe segregation problem can then be understood as an equilibrium statistical\nmechanics problem with two control parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2002 11:36:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2002 15:07:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

This source creates a spectrum\nof beta particles with an energy range similar to that of the SNO 8B solar\nneutrino signal. The source is used to test the SNO detector's energy response,\nposition reconstruction and data reduction algorithms. The 8Li isotope is\ncreated using a deuterium-tritium neutron generator in conjunction with a 11B\ntarget, and is carried to a decay chamber using a gas/aerosol transport system.\nThe decay chamber detects prompt alpha particles by gas scintillation in\ncoincidence with the beta particles which exit through a thin stainless steel\nwall. A description is given of the production, transport, and tagging\ntechniques along with a discussion of the performance and application of the\nsource.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2002 12:45:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
