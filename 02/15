While planets closer than $\\sim$\n5~AU will most likely not survive the post-main sequence lifetime of its parent\nstar, any planet with semimajor axis $>$ 5~AU will survive, and its semimajor\naxis will increase as the central star loses mass. Since the stability of\nadjacent orbits to mutual planet-planet perturbations depends on the ratio of\nthe planet mass to the central star's mass, some planets in previously stable\norbits around a star undergoing mass loss will become unstable. We show that\nwhen mass loss is slow, systems of two planets that are marginally stable can\nbecome unstable to close encounters, while for three planets the timescale for\nclose approaches decreases significantly with increasing mass ratio. These\nprocesses could explain the presence of anomalous IR excesses around white\ndwarfs that cannot be explained by close companions, such as G29-38, and may\nalso be an important factor in explaining the existence of DAZ white dwarfs.\nThe onset of instability through changing mass-ratios will also be a\nsignificant effect for planetary embryos gaining mass in protoplanetary disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2002 19:28:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Up to now, in calculation of\nthe turbulent dynamo, it has been customary to assume that there is no back\nreaction of the magnetic field on the turbulence, as long as the magnetic\nenergy is less than the turbulent kinetic energy. This assumption leads to the\nkinematic dynamo theory. However, the applicability of this theory to\nprotogalaxies is rather limited. The reason is that in protogalaxies the\ntemperature is very high, and the viscosity is dominated by magnetized ions. As\nthe magnetic field strength grows in time, the ion cyclotron time becomes\nshorter than the ion collision time, and the plasma becomes strongly\nmagnetized. As a result, the ion viscosity becomes the Braginskii viscosity.\nThus, in protogalaxies the back reaction sets in much earlier, at field\nstrengths much lower than those which correspond to field-turbulence energy\nequipartition, and the turbulent dynamo becomes what we call the magnetized\nturbulent dynamo. In this paper we lay the theoretical groundwork for the\nmagnetized turbulent dynamo. In particular, we predict that the magnetic energy\ngrowth rate in the magnetized dynamo theory is up to ten time larger than that\nin the kinematic dynamo theory. We also briefly discuss how the Braginskii\nviscosity can aid the development of the inverse cascade of magnetic energy\nafter the energy equipartition is reached.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2002 22:08:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-05"}

We expect this situation to be most relevant when\nthe accretion rate is close to Eddington and the disc is radiation-pressure\ndominated, and so may apply to Narrow-Line Seyfert~1 (NLS1) galaxies. In this\nscenario, the hard X-ray source is obscured for most observers, and so the\ndetected X-ray emission would be dominated by reflection off the walls of the\nsheets. A simple Comptonization calculation shows that the large photon-indices\ncharacteristic of NLS1s would be a natural outcome of two reprocessors closely\nsurrounding the hard X-ray source. We test this model by fitting the XMM-Newton\nspectrum of the NLS1 1H 0707-495 between 0.5 and 11 keV with reflection\ndominated ionized disc models. A very good fit is found with three different\nreflectors each subject to the same \\Gamma=2.35 power-law.

Numerical\nsimulations by a number of authors suggest that roughly 20-50% of binary-binary\nencounters will eject one star but leave behind a stable hierarchical triple.\nIf the orbital plane of the inner binary is strongly tilted with respect to the\norbital plane of the outer object, a secular Kozai resonance, first\ninvestigated in the context of asteroids in the Solar System, can increase the\neccentricity of the inner body significantly. We show that in a substantial\nfraction of cases the eccentricity is driven to a high enough value that the\ninner binary will merge by gravitational radiation, without a strong\naccompanying kick. Thus the merged object remains in the cluster; depending on\nthe binary fraction of black holes and the inclination distribution of\nnewly-formed hierarchical triples, this mechanism may allow massive black holes\nto accumulate through successive mergers in the cores of globular clusters. It\nmay also increase the likelihood that stellar-mass black holes in globular\nclusters will be detectable by their gravitational radiation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Feb 2002 13:07:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Near the antiferromagnetic (AFM)-to-ferromagnetic\n(FM) phase boundary, A-type AFM [AFM(A)] and FM states accompanied by a certain\ntype of orbital ordering are lowered in energy at large JT distortion, which is\nin agreement with the previous strong coupling study. With increasing the\nGdFeO3-type distortion, their phase transition occurs. Through this magnetic\nphase transition, the orbital state hardly changes, which induces nearly\ncontinuous change in the spin coupling along the c-axis from negative to\npositive. The resultant strong two-dimensionality in the spin coupling near the\nphase boundary is attributed to the strong suppression of T_N and T_C, which is\nexperimentally observed. On the other hand, at small GdFeO3-type without JT\ndistortions, which correspond to LaTiO3, the most stable solution is not G-type\nAFM [AFM(G)] but FM. Although the spin-orbit interaction has been considered to\nbe relevant at the small or no JT distortion of LaTiO3 in the literature, our\nanalysis indicates that the spin-orbit interaction is irrelevant to the AFM(G)\nstate in LaTiO3 and superexchange-type interaction dominates.

(1)\nThe property of stochastic resonance (SR) for ST noise is shown to be rather\ndifferent from that for white noise. When SNR for sub-threshold inputs obtained\nin our simulation is analyzed by the expression given by $SNR=10 {\\rm log_{10}}\n[(A/X^{\\alpha}) {\\rm exp}(-B/X)]$ where $X$ expresses the noise intensity and\n$A$ and $B$ are constants, the index $\\alpha$ is $\\alpha=3$ for the ST noise\nand $\\alpha=2$ for the white noise: the former is different from the\nconventional value of $\\alpha=2$ realized in many non-linear systems. ST noise\nworks less effectively for SR than white noise. (2) The transmission fidelity\nevaluated by SNR is much improved by increasing $N$, the size of ensemble\nneurons. In a large-scale neuron ensemble, SNR for supra-threshold inputs is\nshown to be not significantly degraded by weak noises responsible to SR for\nsub-threshold inputs. (3) Interspike intervals (ISIs) of output spikes for\nsub-threshold inputs have a large variability ($c_{v} \\siml 0.8$), which is\ncomparable to the data observed in cortical neurons. Despite variable firings\nof individual neurons, output signals summed over an ensemble may carry\ninformation with a fairly good SNR by the aid of SR and a pooling effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Feb 2002 00:50:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This\nsuggests the specific logic of events as well as complex character of the\nfunction, which describes stochastic behavior of the system, hence the\nparameters of the system are defined by Hermitian operators in the Hilbert\nspace of functions.\n  The model gives an essential way to introduce the basic notions and obtain\nthe results of the quantum theory, to derive the meaning of the main physical\nparameters, such as momentum or electric charge. Based on the proposed\npostulates, Schrodinger equation for the particle is deduced in a way similar\nto inferring of Smoluchowski equation in the classical statistical mechanics.\n  Similarly, the equations of motion of linear fields are established by\nconsidering Smoluchowski-type equations for amplitudes of harmonics.\n  The concept of discrete interaction gives a way to de-couple the object of\nexperiment and a testing device (the traditional source of controversy in\nquantum theory), though at expense of limitation of the principle of locality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Feb 2002 10:28:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 May 2003 10:24:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
