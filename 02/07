This problem is particularly challenging because\nof the vast dynamical range in space which must be covered in the course of\ncol- lapse. We evolve a uniformly rotating SMS from the onset of radial\ninstability at R_{p}/M=411, where R_{p} is the proper polar radius of the star\nand M is the total mass-energy, to the point at which the PN approximation\nbreaks down. We introduce a scale factor and a \"comoving\" coordinate to handle\nthe large varia- tion in radius during the collapse and focus on the central\ncore. Since T/W, the ratio of the rotational kinetic energy to the\ngravitational binding energy, is nearly proportional to 1/R_{p} throughout the\ncollapse, the imploding star may ultimately exceed the critical value of T/W\nfor dynamical instability to bar-mode formation. However, for stars rotating\nuniformly at the onset of col- lapse, we do not find any unstable growth of\nbars prior to the termination of our simulation. We do find that the collapse\nis likely to form a supermassive black hole (BH) coherently, with almost all of\nthe matter falling into the hole, leaving very little ejected matter to form a\ndisk. In the absence of nonaxi- symmetric bar formation, the collapse of a\nuniformly rotating SMS does not lead to appreciable quasi-periodic\ngravitational wave (GW) emission by the time our integrations terminate.\nHowever, the coherent nature of the implosion suggests that rotating SMS\ncollapse will be a promising source of GW bursts. We also expect that,\nfollowing BH formation, long wavelength quasi-periodic waves will result from\nquasi-normal ringing. These waves may be detectable by LISA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Feb 2002 20:55:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This\nleads to three different theories for curves of infinite genus.\n  For analytic curves of infinite genus, to get a theory parallel to algebraic\ngeometry one needs to restrict attention to holomorphic sections satisfying\nsome ``conditions on growth at infinity''. Each such condition effectively\nattaches an ``ideal point'' to the curve; this process is similar to\ncompactification.\n  The theory of holomorphic functions on curves with such ``ideal points'' is\ndeveloped (the variant presented in the first part of the series is tuned to\nthe case \\delta \\approx 0).

This\nproves, for the first time, that the mass of a two-body bound state given by\nthe full theory can in a very good approximation be obtained by summing only\nladder and crossed ladder diagrams using a bare vertex and a constant dressed\nmass. We also discuss the implications of the remarkable cancellation between\nrainbow and crossed rainbow diagrams that is a feature of one-body\ncalculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2002 14:16:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

The resulting cross section is symmetric in the\nscattering angle as those obtained by Aharonov and Bohm (AB) in the string\nlimit and by Landau and Lifshitz (LL) for the non relativistic case. We show\nthat taking pr_0 sin(theta/2) << 1 in our expression of the differential cross\nsection it reduces to that one reported by AB, and if additionally we assume\ntheta << 1 our result becomes the one obtained by LL. However, these limits are\nexplicitly singular in hbar as opposed to our initial result. We analyse the\nsingular behavior in hbar and show that the perturbative Planck limit (hbar ->\n0) is consistent, contrarily to those of the AB and LL expressions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2002 01:12:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
