We analyze the equilibrium behavior of deterministic\nhaploid mutation-selection models. Both the forward and the time-reversed\nevolution processes are considered. The stationary state of the latter is\ncalled the ancestral distribution, which turns out as a key for the study of\nmutation-selection balance. We find that it determines the sensitivity of the\nequilibrium mean fitness to changes in the fitness values and discuss\nimplications for the evolution of mutational robustness. We further show that\nthe difference between the ancestral and the population mean fitness, termed\nmutational loss, provides a measure for the sensitivity of the equilibrium mean\nfitness to changes in the mutation rate. For a class of models in which the\nnumber of mutations in an individual is taken as the trait value, and fitness\nis a function of the trait, we use the ancestor formulation to derive a simple\nmaximum principle, from which the mean and variance of fitness and the trait\nmay be derived; the results are exact for a number of limiting cases, and\notherwise yield approximations which are accurate for a wide range of\nparameters.

This polytope is called the partition polytope of $a$.\nIf $a$ is integral, this polytope contains a finite set of lattice points\ncorresponding to nonnegative integral linear combinations. The partition\npolytope associated to an integral $a$ is a rational convex polytope, and any\nrational convex polytope can be realized canonically as a partition polytope.\nWe consider the problem of counting the number of lattice points in partition\npolytopes, or, more generally, computing sums of values of\nexponential-polynomial functions on the lattice points in such polytopes. We\ngive explicit formulae for these quantities using a notion of multi-dimensional\nresidue due to Jeffrey-Kirwan. We show, in particular, that the dependence of\nthese quantities on $a$ is exponential-polynomial on \"large neighborhoods\" of\nchambers. Our method relies on a theorem of separation of variables for the\ngenerating function, or, more generally, for periodic meromorphic functions\nwith poles on an arrangement of affine hyperplanes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Feb 2002 23:42:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Both the optimum input state and\noptimum feedback are considered for both single-mode dyne measurements and\ntwo-mode interferometric measurements. I derive the optimum input states under\ngeneral dyne measurements when the mean photon number is fixed, both for\ngeneral states and squeezed states. I propose a new feedback scheme that\nintroduces far less phase uncertainty than mark II feedback, and is very close\nto the theoretical limit. I also derive results for the phase variance when\nthere is a time delay in the feedback loop, showing that there is a lower limit\nto the introduced phase variance, and this is approached quite accurately under\nsome conditions. I derive the optimum input states for interferometry, showing\nthat the phase uncertainty scales as 1/N for all the common measures of\nuncertainty. This is contrasted with the |j0>_z state, which does not scale as\n1/N for all measures of phase uncertainty. I introduce an adaptive feedback\nscheme that is very close to optimum, and can give scaling very close to 1/N\nfor the uncertainty.
