After the initial 1998\noutburst, two more outbursts (in 2000 and 2001) were detected with peak\nluminosities about two orders of magnitude larger than our Chandra luminosity.\nOur Chandra observation falls in-between those two outbursts, making the\noutburst history for SAX J1747.0-2853 complex. Those bright 2000 and 2001\noutbursts combined with the likely extended period of low level activity\nin-between those outbursts strongly suggest that the classification of SAX\nJ1747.0-2853 as a faint X-ray transient was premature.

This takes into account that the\nwarp is produced as a reorientation of the different rings which constitute the\ndisc in order to compensate the differential precession generated by the\nexternal force, yielding a uniform asymptotic precession for all rings.\n  Application of this method to gravitational tidal forces in the Milky Way due\nto the Magellanic Clouds leads to a very low amplitude of the warp. If the\nforce were due to an extragalactic magnetic field, its intensity would have to\nbe very high, to generate the observed warps. An alternative hypothesis is\nexplored: the accretion of the intergalactic medium over the disk. A cup-shaped\ndistortion is expected, due to the transmission of the linear momentum; but,\nthis effect is small and the predominant effect turns out to be the\ntransmission of angular momentum, i.e. a torque giving an integral-sign shape\nwarp. The torque produced by a flow of velocity ~100 km/s and baryon density\n\\~10^{-25} kg/m^3 is enough to generate the observed warps and this mechanism\noffers quite a plausible explanation. First, because this order of accretion\nrate is inferred from other processes observed in the Galaxy, notably its\nchemical evolution. The inferred rate of infall of matter, ~1 solar-mass/yr, to\nthe Galactic disc that this theory predicts agrees with the quantitative\npredictions of this chemical evolution resolving key issues, notably the\nG-dwarf problem. Second, because the required density of the intergalactic\nmedium is within the range of values compatible with observation. By this\nmechanism, we can explain the warp phenomenon in terms of intergalactic\naccretion flows onto the disk of the galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2002 16:24:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We\nconstructed a tilted ellipsoidal shell model by fitting the radio brightness\nvariation of the 5 and 15 GHz VLA observations, and making use of the\nground-based echelle spectra from Bryce & Mellema (1999), to estimate distance.\nOur model has an axial ratio of 1.56, is inclined to the line of sight by 9.7\ndegrees, and exhibits an expansion in the plane of the sky which is 2/3 that in\nthe radial direction, leading to a distance of 1.2 kpc. Not all the kinematic\ndata fits this simple model, so the distance must still be regarded as\nuncertain. Based on the recent model atmosphere of Crowther et al. (2002), a\ndistance of 1.2 kpc implies a stellar luminosity of 4250 L_sun. The kinematic\nage of the nebula varies somewhat from region to region; a good average value\nis 800 years, while the expansion along the position of the echelle slit gives\nabout 600 years.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Feb 2002 00:28:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

A recently developed quark model with an\neffective Lagrangian is employed to account for the non-diffractive {\\it s}-\nand {\\it u}-channel processes; the diffractive feature arising from the {\\it\nnatural} parity exchange is accounted for by the {\\it t}-channel pomeron\nexchange, while the {\\it unnatural} parity exchange is accounted for by the\n{\\it t}-channel pion exchange. In the $\\omega$ production, the isotopic effects\ncould provide more information concerning the search of \"missing resonances\",\nwhile in the $\\phi$ production, the isotopic effects could highlight\nnon-diffractive resonance excitation mechanisms at large angles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2002 19:35:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}
