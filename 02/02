We suggest a paradigm that might allow for a non-anthropic\nsolution to this cosmic coincidence problem. The fact that the half life of\nUranium 238 is very near to the age of the solar system is not considered a\ncoincidence since there are many nuclides with half lives ranging over a huge\nrange of time scales implying that there is likely to be some nuclide with a\nhalf life near to any given time scale. Likewise it may be that the vacuum\nfield energy causing the universal acceleration today is just one of a large\nensemble of scalar field energies, which have dominated the Universe in the\npast and then faded away. Given that in standard cosmology and particle physics\nthere are already several scalar fields that probably contribute to universal\nvacuum energy (the Higgs field, the inflaton, and whatever quintessence/dark\nenergy field causes the current acceleration), the idea of a large ensemble of\nfields does not seem far fetched. Predictions of the idea include: 1) The\ncurrent vacuum energy driving the acceleration is not constant and will\neventually fade away, 2) The ratio w of scalar field pressure to density is\ncurrently changing and is not precisely negative one, 3) There were likely\nperiods of vacuum dominance and acceleration in the past, 4) the current phase\nof acceleration will end but there may be additional periods of acceleration in\nthe future, 5) the ultimate fate of the Universe cannot be decided until the\nnature of these fields is known, but the eventual sum of densities from all\nscalar fields could be zero, as was usually assumed before the discovery of the\ncurrent universal acceleration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Feb 2002 00:35:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Oct 2002 18:42:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

A non-vanishing value can arise from a subtle interplay\nbetween a divergent integral over bosonic moduli and a vanishing integral over\nfermionic moduli. The one-instanton contribution to such Wilson loops is\nexplicitly evaluated in semi-classical approximation. The method utilizes the\nsymmetries of the problem to perform the integration over the bosonic and\nfermionic collective coordinates of the instanton. The integral is singular for\nsmall instantons touching the loop and is regularized by introducing a cutoff\nat the boundary of the (euclidean) AdS_5 moduli space. In the case of a\ncircular loop a nonzero finite result is obtained when the cutoff is removed\nand a perimeter divergence subtracted. This is contrasted with the case of the\nstraight line where the result is zero after subtraction of an identical\ndivergence per unit length.

The model can serve as a module for voice signal processing, it is a\none dimensional (in space) damped dispersive nonlinear PDE based on mechanics\nand phenomenology of hearing. It describes the motion of basilar membrane (BM)\nin the cochlea driven by input pressure waves. Both elastic damping and\nselective longitudinal fluid damping are present. The former is nonlinear and\nnonlocal in BM displacement, and plays a key role in capturing tonal\ninteractions. The latter is active only near the exit boundary (helicotrema),\nand is built in to damp out the remaining long waves. The initial boundary\nvalue problem is numerically solved with a semi-implicit second order finite\ndifference method. Solutions reach a multi-frequency quasi-steady state.\nNumerical results are shown on two tone suppression from both high-frequency\nand low-frequency sides, consistent with known behavior of two tone\nsuppression. Suppression effects among three tones are demonstrated by showing\nhow the response magnitudes of the fixed two tones are reduced as we vary the\nthird tone in frequency and amplitude. We observe qualitative agreement of our\nmodel solutions with existing cat auditory neural data. The model is thus\nsimple and efficient as a processing tool for voice signals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2002 22:06:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2002 20:40:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 20 Sep 2002 18:17:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

The tier structure implies strong\ncorrelations between the energy level motions of a quantum system and its\nintensity-weighted spectrum. A measure, which explicitly accounts for this\ncorrealtion, was first introduced by one of us as a sensitive probe of phase\nspace localization. It correlates eigenlevel velocities with the overlap\nintensities between the eigenstates and some localized state of interest. A\nsemiclassical theory for the correlation is developed for systems that are\nclassically integrable and complements earlier work focusing exclusively on the\nchaotic case. Application to a model two dimensional effective spectroscopic\nHamiltonian shows that the correlation measure can provide information about\nthe terms in the molecular Hamiltonian which play an important role in an\nenergy range of interest and the character of the dynamics. Moreover, the\ncorrelation function is capable of highlighting relevant phase space structures\nincluding the local resonance features associated with a specific bright state.\nIn addition to being ideally suited for multidimensional systems with a large\ndensity of states, the measure can also be used to gain insights into the phase\nspace transport and localization. It is argued that the overlap intensity-level\nvelocity correlation function provides a novel way of studying vibrational\nenergy redistribution in isolated molecules. The correlation function is\nideally suited to analyzing the parametric spectra of molecules in external\nfields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Feb 2002 11:27:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
