We do\nnot detect three of the four targeted LSB galaxies in HI down to a 4-sigma\nlimit of 0.08Jy km/s. We find that two of the four of these LSBs have bright\ngalaxies which have contaminated the Arecibo signal. A further examination of\nthe Arecibo sample shows that five out of the six galaxies that were found to\ndeviate from TF have nearby bright galaxies and we conclude that possibly all\nbut one of the non-TF galaxies are contaminated by HI from nearby galaxies. The\nsixth galaxy was not detected by us. A new observation by Arecibo did not\nconfirm the earlier detection. The integrated profiles of the bright galaxies\nare consistent with the Arecibo results both in velocity range and amplitude,\nwhich indicates that most of the extreme deviators from the TF relation must\nhave been affected by bright companions in this earlier HI survey. A more\nrecent determination of the sidelobe structure of the Arecibo beam supports our\nconclusion and shows that the degree of sidelobe contamination was much larger\nthan could have been initially predicted. Hence, we have corrected the results\nfound in O'Neil et al. (2000) and have reconstructed the TF relation. These new\nobservations then show a) a reconstructed TF relation that has relatively large\nscatter at all values of rotational velocity (possibly indicating the true\nrange in disk galaxy properties) and b) the presence of at least some red, gas\npoor, LSB disks that indeed may be in an advanced evolutionary state as the\nfaded remnants of their former high surface brightness actively star forming\nstate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Feb 2002 01:27:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2002 15:23:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

Unfortunately, this method\nhas important limitations in identifying the existence of multiple planets and\ndetermining their parameters due to the degeneracy of the resulting light curve\nanomalies from those induced by a single planet and the complexity of multiple\nplanet lensing models. In this paper, we propose a new channel to search for\nmultiple planets via microlensing. The method is based on the fact that the\nanomalies induced by multiple planets are well approximated by the\nsuperposition of those of the single planet systems where the individual\nplanet-primary pairs act as independent lens systems. Then, if the source\ntrajectory passes both of the outer deviation regions induced by the individual\nplanets, one can unambiguously identify the existence of the multiple planets.\nWe illustrate that the probability of successively detecting light curve\nanomalies induced by two Jovian-mass planets located in the lensing zone\nthrough this channel will be substantial. Since the individual anomalies can be\nwell modeled by much simpler single planet lensing models, the proposed method\nhas an important advantage of allowing one to accurately determine the\nparameters of the individual planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Feb 2002 02:52:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-18"}

The thermal corrections to the\nCasimir force between real metals were recently computed by several authors\nusing different approaches based on the Lifshitz formula with diverse results.\nBoth the Drude and plasma models were used to describe a real metal. We\ncalculate the entropy density of photons between metallic plates as a function\nof the surface separation and temperature. Some of these approaches are\ndemonstrated to lead to negative values of entropy and to nonzero entropy at\nzero temperature depending on the parameters of the system. The conclusion is\nthat these approaches are in contradiction with the third law of thermodynamics\nand must be rejected. It is shown that the plasma dielectric function in\ncombination with the unmodified Lifshitz formula is in perfect agreement with\nthe general principles of thermodynamics.
