This suggested the\nneed for additional \"hidden variables\", allowing for the recovery of\ndeterminism and locality, but such a solution has been disproved\nexperimentally. Here, I present an opposite solution, based on the greater\nindeterminism of the modern quantum theory of Particle Physics, predicting that\nthe number of photons is always uncertain. No violation of locality is allowed\nfor the physical reality, and the theory can fulfill the EPR criterion of\ncompleteness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Feb 2002 11:55:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
