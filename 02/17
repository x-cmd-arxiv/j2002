I hypothesize\nthat the observable universe, u0, constitutes a Universal Turing Machine (UTM)\nconstrained by algorithmically random logical tape parameters defining its\nmaterial properties (a physical UTM). The finite non-zero empirical values of\nPlanck's constant, h, and other constants of nature exemplify those logical\nparameters. Their algorithmic randomness is necessary and sufficient for the\nconsistent operation of a physical UTM. At any given time, ti, these constants\ncorrespond to the first n random halt digits, Omega-n, of Chaitin's Halting\nProbability, Omega. Planck's equation E=hv and Boltzmann's relation S=kLogW are\nshown to apply to the operation of a physical UTM. The genomic evolution of u0\nin constants of nature space (CON space) from an undecidable state in u0's\nPlanck era to its current ordered condition occurs through the algorithmically\nrandom, symmetry-breaking addition of new constants to the laws by which u0\noperates -- a process called logical tunneling. The temperature of u0 for t<=tp\nis shown to be T=0K. The energy dissipated when a physical UTM clears its\nmemory after each computation is proposed as a candidate for cold dark matter\n(CDM) and is calculated to comprise 87.5% of the cosmological matter content,\nOmega-M, of u0. This result concurs with current astronomical estimates that\n87.1% of the matter content of u0 consists of CDM. The energy incorporated in\nu0 through the process of logical tunneling from undecidable states of the\ncomplete Universe, E, to decidable states of u0 is suggested as a candidate for\nthe unexplained \"dark energy\", Omega-X, hypothesized to drive the accelerating\ncosmological expansion of space and believed to constitute 66% of the critical\nmass, Omega-0, of the observable universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Feb 2002 17:48:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2002 19:54:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 16 Mar 2002 20:50:40 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 24 Jul 2013 20:59:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-26"}

There is a discrepancy between my result for\nksle(5|10) and Kac' and Rudakov's one.\n  Since the grade zero subalgebra of vle(3|6) and mb(3|8) is sl(3)+sl(2)+gl(1),\ngauge theories based on these algebras can be viewed as a \"second-gauged\"\nversion of the standard model, where the rigid sl(3)+sl(2)+gl(1), symmetry is\nmade local not only in spacetime (\"first gauging\"), but in the internal\ndirections as well. An attempt to construct such a second-gauged theory is\npresented.

Given a 3-regualr graph with\norientation, we construct a finite-area hyperbolic Riemann surface by gluing\ntriangles according to the combinatorics of the graph. We then compactify this\nsurface by adding finitely many points.\n  We discuss this construction by considering a number of examples. In\nparticular, we see that the surface depends in a strong way on the orientation.\n  We then consider the effect the process of compactification has on the\nhyperbolic metric of the surface. To that end, we ask when we can change the\nmetric in the horocycle neighbourhoods of the cusps to get a hyperbolic metric\non the compactification. In general, the process of compactification can have\ndrastic effects on the hyperbolic structure. For instance, if we compactify the\n3-punctured sphere we lose its hyperbolic structure.\n  We show that when the cusps have lengths > 2\\pi, we can fill in the horocycle\nneighbourhoods and retain negative curvature. Furthermore, the last condition\nis sharp. We show by examples that there exist curves arbitrarily close to\nhorocycles of length 2\\pi, which cannot be so filled in. Such curves can even\nbe taken to be convex.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Feb 2002 09:44:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
