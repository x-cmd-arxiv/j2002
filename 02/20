If gas-phase fractionation can\nproduce a high abundance of atomic deuterium, which then accretes onto grain\nsurfaces, diffusive surface chemistry can produce large abundances of\ndeuterated species, especially at low temperatures and high gas densities.\nWarming temperatures will then permit these surface species to evaporate into\nthe gas, where they will remain abundant for a considerable period. We\ncalculate that the doubly deuterated molecules CHD2OH and CH2DOD are\nparticularly abundant and should be searched for in the gas phase of\nprotostellar sources. For example, at 10 K and high density, these species can\nachieve up to 10-20% of the abundance of methanol.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2002 10:49:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

This measures\nhow well (or how bad) the asset performs over that given period of time. It has\nbeen established that the distribution of returns exhibits ``fat tails''\nindicating that large returns occur more frequently than what is expected from\nstandard Gaussian stochastic processes (Mandelbrot-1967,Stanley1,Doyne).\nInstead of estimating this ``fat tail'' distribution of returns, we propose\nhere an alternative approach, which is outlined by addressing the following\nquestion: What is the smallest time interval needed for an asset to cross a\nfixed return level of say 10%? For a particular asset, we refer to this time as\nthe {\\it investment horizon} and the corresponding distribution as the {\\it\ninvestment horizon distribution}. This latter distribution complements that of\nreturns and provides new and possibly crucial information for portfolio design\nand risk-management, as well as for pricing of more exotic options. By\nconsidering historical financial data, exemplified by the Dow Jones Industrial\nAverage, we obtain a novel set of probability distributions for the investment\nhorizons which can be used to estimate the optimal investment horizon for a\nstock or a future contract.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2002 15:37:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-02"}

We present a\ncomplete description of an algorithm to numerically compute the perturbative\nexpansions.
