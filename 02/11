In the cores of\nclusters, bright, irregular X-ray emission is now routinely seen within central\ndominant galaxies (CDGs) harboring powerful radio sources. The radio sources\nare interacting with and are often displacing the hot gas leaving cavities in\ntheir wakes. The cavities rise buoyantly, transporting up to 10E61 ergs of\nenergy to the intracluster medium over the life of a cluster. The dynamically\nimportant magnetic fields observed in cooling flows may have originated from\nthese cavities. The cooling rates found by Chandra and XMM-Newton are much\nsmaller than previously reported, and they are more in line with the levels of\ncold gas and star formation seen in other bandpasses. I discuss the emerging\ncorrelation between extended H-alpha emission, star formation, and bright X-ray\nemission at locations where the cooling time of the keV gas approaches a few\nhundred million years. Data from a variety of disciplines suggest repeated,\nshort duration bursts of cooling and star formation are occurring, possibly\ninduced and regulated in some instances by the central radio source. Finally, I\ndiscuss the interesting possibility that radio sources quench cooling flows,\nwhile emphasizing the difficulties with some proposed scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Feb 2002 19:03:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This paper is a\ntutorial and colloquial introduction to the explicit classification of Fano\n3-folds (Q-Fano 3-folds), a subject that we hope is nearing completion. With\nthe intention of remaining accessible to beginners in algebraic geometry, we\ninclude examples of elementary calculations of graded rings over curves and K3\nsurfaces.

A second section of the paper runs briefly through the classical\ntheory of nonsingular Fano 3-folds and Mukai's extension to indecomposable\nGorenstein Fano 3-folds. Ideas sketched out by Takagi at the Singapore\nconference reduce the study of Q-Fano 3-folds with g>=2 to indecomposable\nGorenstein Fano 3-folds together with unprojection data.\n  Much of the information about the anticanonical ring of a Fano 3-fold or K3\nsurface is contained in its Hilbert series. The Hilbert function is given by\norbifold Riemann--Roch (see Reid's Young Person's Guide); using this, we can\ntreat the Hilbert series as a simple collation of the genus and a basket of\ncyclic quotient singularities. Many hundreds of families of K3s and Fano\n3-folds are known, among them a large number with g<=0, and Takagi's methods do\nnot apply to these. However, in many cases, the Hilbert series already gives\nfirm indications of how to construct the variety by biregular or birational\nmethods. A final section of the paper introduces the K3 database in Magma, that\nmanipulates these huge lists without effort.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Feb 2002 00:47:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
