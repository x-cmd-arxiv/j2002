Our Galactic center survey provides an\nunprecedented high-resolution, broad-band X-ray panorama of a 0.8x2 square\ndegree swath along the Galactic plane. Our preliminary analysis has led a\ndetection of about 1000 discrete sources. We find that the diffuse X-ray\nemission dominates over the contribution from faint discrete sources and is\nglobally associated with distinct interstellar structures observed at radio and\nmid-infrared wavelengths. We study how high-energy activities in the center\nregion affect the immediate vicinity and may influence other aspects of the\nGalaxy. We have further observed nearby edge-on late-type disk galaxies in\nfields of low foreground Galactic extinction to gain external perspectives of\nthe global disk/halo interaction. We have detected a giant diffuse\nX-ray-emitting corona around the galactic disk of NGC 4631. Extraplanar diffuse\nX-ray emission is also detected around NGC 3556. These X-ray-emitting coronae\nmorphologically resemble the radio halos of these galaxies, indicating a close\nconnection between outflows of hot gas, cosmic rays, and magnetic field from\nthe galactic disks. There is only marginal evidence for extraplanar diffuse\nX-ray emission in NGC 4244 -- a galaxy with an extremely low star formation\nrate. In general, the extraplanar diffuse X-ray emission is evidently related\nto recent massive star forming activities in the galactic disks, especially in\ntheir central regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Feb 2002 17:14:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
