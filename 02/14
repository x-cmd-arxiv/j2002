Deep inside the bar, two massive molecular spirals cover\nnearly 180 degrees in azimuth, show streaming motions of 20--40 km/s and feed a\nstarburst ring of super star clusters at 375 pc. They also connect to two\nnarrow K-band spirals which delineate the UV-bright star clusters in the ring.\nThe data suggest that the K-band spirals are young, and the starburst has been\ntriggered by a bar-driven spiral density wave (SDW). The latter may even have\npropagated closer to the center where a second Halpha ring and a dust spiral\nare found. The molecular and HST data support a scenario where stellar winds\nand supernovae efficiently clear out gas from dense star-forming regions on\ntimescales less than a few Myrs.

It also confirms that a low central mass concentration, which may be\ncommon in late-type galaxies, is particularly favorable to the propagation of a\nbar-driven gaseous SDW deep into the central region of the galaxy, whereas a\nlarge central mass concentration favors other processes, such as the formation\nand decoupling of nuclear bars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2002 11:44:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Apr 2002 05:18:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The aim is to provide an\nuncertainty range on methods employed in implementing these effects as well as\nan insight on their relevance when an ``exact'' calculation is possible. Using\na wave function corresponding to a mass operator that has the appropriate\nproperties to construct the generators of the Poincar\\'{e} algebra in the\nframework of relativistic quantum mechanics, form factors are calculated using\nthe boost transformations pertinent to the instant, front and point forms of\nthis approach. Moderately and strongly bound systems are considered with masses\nof the exchanged boson taken as zero, 0.15 times the constituent mass $m$, and\ninfinity. In the first and last cases, a comparison with ``exact'' calculations\nis made (Wick-Cutkosky model and Feynman triangle diagram). Results with a\nGalilean boost are also given. Momentum transfers up to $Q^2=100 m^2$ are\nconsidered. Emphasis is put on the contribution of the single-particle current,\nas usually done. It is found that the present point-form calculations of form\nfactors strongly deviate from all the other ones, requiring large contributions\nfrom two-body currents. Different implementations of the point-form approach,\nwhere the role of these two-body currents would be less important, are\nsketched.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2002 14:32:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2002 17:57:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
