As an old population of\nstars, globular clusters contain many collapsed and degenerate objects. As a\ndense population of stars, globular clusters are the scene of many interesting\nclose dynamical interactions between stars. These dynamical interactions can\nalter the evolution of individual stars and can produce tight binary systems\ncontaining one or two compact objects. In this review, we discuss the\ntheoretical models of globular cluster evolution and binary evolution,\ntechniques for simulating this evolution which lead to relativistic binaries,\nand current and possible future observational evidence for this population.\nGlobular cluster evolution will focus on the properties that boost the\nproduction of hard binary systems and on the tidal interactions of the galaxy\nwith the cluster, which tend to alter the structure of the globular cluster\nwith time. The interaction of the components of hard binary systems alters the\nevolution of both bodies and can lead to exotic objects. Direct $N$-body\nintegrations and Fokker-Planck simulations of the evolution of globular\nclusters that incorporate tidal interactions and lead to predictions of\nrelativistic binary populations are also discussed.

Therefore, a Delta-resonance decaying in the nuclear medium can\nproduce far off-shell pions, which will gradually lose their virtuality while\npropagating to the vacuum. To describe such off-shell dynamics, we implemented\na pion spectral function for finite nuclear matter density -- calculated on the\nbasis of the Delta-hole model -- in the BUU transport approach. The pion\noff-shell dynamics leads to an enhancement of the low-p_t pion yields in the\ncollisions of Au+Au at 1 A GeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Feb 2002 14:13:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2002 15:20:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 24 Jul 2002 09:43:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-25"}
