A {\\em strong\n$r$-coloring} is a partition of the vertices into $r$ parts, such that each\nedge of $H$ intersects each part. A strong $r$-coloring is called {\\em\nequitable} if the size of each part is $\\lceil n/r \\rceil$ or $\\lfloor n/r\n\\rfloor$. We prove that for all $a \\geq 1$, if the maximum degree of $H$\nsatisfies $\\Delta(H) \\leq k^a$ then $H$ has an equitable coloring with\n$\\frac{k}{a \\ln k}(1-o_k(1))$ parts. In particular, every $k$-uniform\nhypergraph with maximum degree $O(k)$ has an equitable coloring with\n$\\frac{k}{\\ln k}(1-o_k(1))$ parts. The result is asymptotically tight. The\nproof uses a double application of the non-symmetric version of the Lov\\'asz\nLocal Lemma.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2002 15:13:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
