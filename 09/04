We propose a method to\ndescribe the evolution of the disk surface density, eccentricity, and\ninclination caused by the embryo-planetesimal interaction. It relies on the\nanalytical treatment of the scattering in two extreme regimes of the\nplanetesimal epicyclic velocities: shear-dominated (dynamically ``cold'') and\ndispersion-dominated (dynamically ``hot''). In the former, planetesimal\nscattering can be treated as a deterministic process. In the latter, scattering\nis mostly weak because of the large relative velocities of interacting bodies.\nThis allows one to use the Fokker-Planck approximation and the two-body\napproximation to explore the disk evolution. We compare the results obtained by\nthis method with the outcomes of the direct numerical integrations of\nplanetesimal orbits and they agree quite well. In the intermediate velocity\nregime an approximate treatment of the disk evolution is proposed based on\ninterpolation between the two extreme regimes.

The embryo's growth is self-consistently coupled to the planetesimal disk\ndynamics. We demonstrate that details of the evolution depend on only two\ndimensionless parameters incorporating all the physical characteristics of the\nproblem: the ratio of the physical radius to the Hill radius of any solid body\nin the disk and the number of planetesimals inside the annulus of the disk with\nwidth equal to the planetesimal Hill radius. The results of exploration in the\nframework of our model of several situations typical for protosolar nebula can\nbe summarized as follows: initially, the planetesimal disk dynamics is not\naffected by the presence of the embryo and the growth of the embryo's mass\nproceeds very rapidly in the runaway regime.

That Io is electrodynamically linked to\nJupiter is known for nearly four decades from the radio emissions. Io\ninfluences Jupiter by supplying heavy ions to its magnetosphere, which\ndominates its energetic and dynamics. Jupiter influences Io by tidally heating\nits interior, which in turn drives the volcanic activity on Io. The role of Io\nand Jupiter in their mutual interaction and the nature of their coupling were\nfirst elaborated in greater detail by the two Voyagers flybys in 1979.\nSubsequent exploration of this system by ground-based and Earth-satellite-borne\nobservatories and by the Galileo orbiter mission has improved our understanding\nof the highly complex electrodynamical interaction between Io and Jupiter many\nfold.

The Schwinger-Keldysh closed-time-path (CTP)\nformalism is utilized along with the two-particle-irreducible (2PI) effective\naction in order to obtain coupled, nonperturbative equations for the mean field\nand variance in a general curved background spacetime. For a model consisting\nof a quartically self-interacting O(N) field theory (with unbroken symmetry) in\nspatially flat FRW spacetime, the dynamics of the mean field is studied\nnumerically, at leading order in the large-N expansion. The time evolution of\nthe scale factor is determined self-consistently using the semiclassical\nEinstein equation. It is found that cosmic expansion can dramatically affect\nthe efficiency of parametric resonance-induced particle production. The\nproduction of fermions due to the oscillating inflaton mean field is studied\nfor the case of a scalar inflaton coupled to a fermion field via a Yukawa\ncoupling $f$.

If the binary contains neutron\nstars, measuring such waves can teach us about the properties of matter at\nextreme densities. Unfortunately, these waves are typically at high frequency\nwhere the sensitivity of broad-band detectors is not good. Learning about dense\nmatter from these waves will require networks of broad-band detectors combined\nwith narrow-band detectors that have good sensitivity at high frequencies. This\npaper presents an algorithm by which a network can be ``tuned'', in accordance\nwith the best available information, in order to most effectively measure\nmerger waves. The algorithm is presented in the context of a toy model that\ncaptures the qualitative features of narrow-band detectors and of certain\nbinary neutron star merger wave models. By using what is learned from a\nsequence of merger measurements, the network can be gradually tuned in order to\naccurately measure the waves. The number of measurements needed to reach this\nstage depends upon the waves' signal strength, the number of narrow-band\ndetectors available for the measurement, and the detailed characteristics of\nthe waves that carry the merger information. Future studies will go beyond this\ntoy model, encompassing a more realistic description of both the detectors and\nthe gravitational waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2002 01:24:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

In other words, all test particles travel on five-dimensional geodesics\nbut observers, who are bounded to spacetime, have access only to the 4D part of\nthe trajectory. Conventionally, the dynamics of test particles as observed in\n4D is discussed on the basis of the splitting of the geodesic equation in 5D.\nHowever, this procedure is {\\em not} unique and therefore leads to some\nproblems. The most serious one is the ambiguity in the definition of rest mass\nin 4D, which is crucial for the discussion of the dynamics. We propose the\nHamilton-Jacobi formalism, instead of the geodesic one, to study the dynamics\nin 4D. On the basis of this formalism we provide an unambiguous expression for\nthe rest mass and its variation along the motion as observed in 4D. It is\nindependent of the coordinates and any parameterization used along the motion.\nAlso, we are able to show a comprehensive picture of the various physical\nscenarios allowed in 4D, without having to deal with the subtle details of the\nsplitting formalism. Moreover we study the extra non-gravitational forces\nperceived by an observer in 4D who describes the geodesic motion of a bulk test\nparticle in 5D.
