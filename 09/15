We detected superhumps characteristic to SU UMa-type dwarf\nnovae ~7 d after the optical maximum. The overall behavior of the light curve\nand the development of superhumps were characteristic to a WZ Sge-type dwarf\nnova. Combined with the past literature, we have been able to uniquely\ndetermine the superhump period to be 0.05648(2) d. From this period, together\nwith a modern interpretation of the absolute magnitude of the outburst light\ncurve, we conclude that the overall picture of V592 Her is not inconsistent\nwith a lower main-sequence secondary star in contrast to a previous claim that\nV592 Her contains a brown dwarf.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Sep 2002 04:46:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Oct 2002 03:13:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

However, this\nproduct is in general not associative and does not yield the quantum space. It\nis shown that there are certain Drinfeld twists which realize the associative\nproduct of the quantum plane, quantum Euclidean 4-space, and quantum Minkowski\nspace.

From these\nmodels we have calculated the fission cross section of the 77 eV isomer of\n$^{235}$U over the same energy range. We find that the ratio of the isomer\ncross section to that of the ground state lies between about 0.45 and 0.55 at\nlow neutron energies. The cross sections become approximately equal above 1\nMeV. The ratio of the neutron capture cross section to the fission cross\nsection for the isomer is predicted to be about a factor of 3 larger for the\nisomer than for the ground state of $^{235}$U at keV neutron energies. We have\nalso calculated the cross section for the population of the isomer by inelastic\nneutron scattering form the $^{235}$U ground state. We find that the isomer is\nstrongly populated, and for $E_n = 1 MeV$ the $(n,n'\\gamma)$ cross section\nleading to the population of the isomer is of the order of 0.5 barn. Thus,\nneutron reaction network calculations involving the uranium isotopes in a high\nneutron fluence are likely to be affected by the 77 eV isomer of $^{235}$U.\nWith these same models the fission cross sections of $^{233}$U and $^{237}$U\ncan be reproduced approximately using only minor adjustments to the barrier\nheights. With the significant lowering of the outer barrier that is expected\nfor the outer barrier the general behavior of the fission cross section of\n$^{239}$Pu can also be reproduced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Sep 2002 21:50:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
