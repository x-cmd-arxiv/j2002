In this paper we\nshow that sampling fluctuations also introduce systematic biases and\nmulti-modality in non-linear functions of the SED, such as luminosity ratios,\nmagnitudes and colours. In some cases, the distribution functions of rational\nand logarithmic quantities are bimodal, hence complicating considerably the\ninterpretation of these quantities in terms of age or evolutionary stages.\nThese biases can be only assessed by Monte Carlo simulations.

Predictions from any model of stellar\npopulation synthesis become extremely unreliable for small Neff values,\nproviding an operational limit to the applicability of such models for the\ninterpretation of integrated properties of stellar systems. In terms of stellar\nmasses, assuming a Salpeter Initial Mass Function in the range 0.08 -- 120 Mo,\nNeff=10 corresponds to about 10**5 Mo (although the exact value depends on the\nage and the observable).

Through the measurements of blue- and\nredshifts the complex dynamics of these plasmas is revealed. Quite intriguing\nin this respect is the case of X-ray absorption of neutral matter. In many\ncases spectral features are found to be of high complexity though the detection\nof edges from intermediate Z elements as well as absorption lines from\nmonatomic species to molecular compounds. With the application of line\ndiagnostic tools and more accurate atomic data bases we are now able to model\nthe properties of these plasmas as well as measure line shifts and shapes to\nconstrain their spatial distribution and dynamics. In various examples, i.e.\nplasmas from accretion disks, winds, stationary clouds as well as the ISM, the\npower of highly resolved X-ray spectra is demonstrated and the scientific\ncapability of XEUS in this context is explored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2002 23:10:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This is done by constructing a self-consistent\nmodel based on 2-D radiative transfer coupled to the equation of vertical\nhydrostatics. As a simplifying assumption a grey opacity is used. It is found\nthat the disk can adopt four different structures, dependent on the surface\ndensity distribution Sigma(R) as a function of radius, i.e. on radial- and\nvertical optical depth of the disk. For the case of high to intermediate\nvertical optical depth, the temperature and density structures are in agreement\nwith the simple ``disk with inner hole'' model of Dullemond, Dominik & Natta\n(2001, henceforth DDN01). At large radii the disk adopts a flaring shape as\nexpected, and near the dust destruction radius (located at about 0.5 AU for\nmost Herbig Ae stars) the disk is superheated and puffs up. The region directly\nbehind this ``puffed-up inner dust wall'' is shadowed, as predicted by DDN01.\nFor the case of intermediate to low vertical optical depth, but still high\nradial optical depth, the 2-D models show that the shadow can cover the entire\ndisk. The disk is then no longer flaring. When the disk is optically thin even\nin radial direction, it becomes unshadowed again because the inner rim can no\nlonger block the stellar light. Finally, for disks that flare at intermediate\nradii, but become too optically thin at large radii, the outer parts once again\nbecome shadowed. But this time the shadowing is caused by the flaring part of\nthe disk instead of the inner rim. Observational consequences of these four\ngeometries are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2002 08:45:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

At this\nlevel of precision there are twenty predictions. Among them there are the well\nknown Gell-Mann Okubo and equal spacing relations, and four new relations\ninvolving SU(3) breaking splittings in different SU(3) multiplets. Although the\nbreaking of SU(6) symmetry occurs at zeroth order in 1/Nc, it turns out to be\nsmall. The dominant source of the breaking is the hyperfine interaction which\nis of order 1/Nc. The spin-orbit interaction, of zeroth order in 1/Nc, is\nentirely fixed by the splitting between the singlet states Lambda(1405) and\nLambda(1520), and the spin-orbit puzzle is solved by the presence of other\nzeroth order operators involving flavor exchange.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2002 18:15:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-17"}

Despite many striking similarities with some of the key\ntopological features of the two $(1 + 1)$-dimensional (2D) free Abelian (and\nself-interacting non-Abelian) gauge theories, it turns out that the 4D free\nAbelian 2-form gauge theory is {\\it not} an exact TFT. To corroborate this\nconclusion, some of the key issues are discussed. In particular, it is shown\nthat the (anti-)BRST and (anti-)co-BRST invariant quantities of the 4D 2-form\nAbelian gauge theory obey the recursion relations that are reminiscent of the\nexact TFTs but the Lagrangian density of this theory is not found to be able to\nbe expressed as the sum of (anti-)BRST and (anti-)co-BRST exact quantities as\nis the case with the {\\it topological} 2D free Abelian (and self-interacting\nnon-Abelian) gauge theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2002 14:12:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2002 12:24:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 21 Mar 2003 17:02:47 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 26 Apr 2003 10:49:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

As in KAM theory, small divisors cause\ndifficulties in the perturbation theory, and the convergence of the standard\nmethod is questionable in spite of the bound on the small divisors. We compute\nsteady quasipattern solutions of the cubic Swift--Hohenberg equation up to 33rd\norder to illustrate the issues in some detail, and argue that the standard\nmethod does not converge sufficiently rapidly to be regarded as a reliable way\nof calculating properties of quasipatterns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2002 10:38:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
