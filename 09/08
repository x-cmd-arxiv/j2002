This system allows simultaneous background limited\nmeasurements of the Stokes I and Q parameters over ~ 30% bandwidths at\nfrequencies from ~ 60 to 600 GHz. Since both linear polarizations traverse\nidentical optical paths from the sky to the point of detection, the\nsusceptibility to systematic effects is minimized. The amount of uncorrelated\nnoise between the two polarization senses is limited to the quantum limit of\nthermal and photon shot noise, while drifts in the relative responsivity to\northogonal polarizations are limited to the effect of non-uniformity in the\nthin film deposition of the leads and the intrinsic thermistor properties.\nDevices using NTD Ge thermistors have achieved NEPs of 2 x 10^{-17} W/sqrt{Hz}\nwith a 1/f knee below 100 mHz at a base temperature of 270 mK.

In the case of diamond and\nzinc-blende photonic crystals, several complete photonic band gaps (CPBG's) can\nopen in the spectrum, between the 2nd-3rd, 5th-6th, and 8th-9th bands. Unlike\nin the purely dielectric case, in the presence of small inclusions of a low\nabsorbing metal the largest CPBG for a moderate dielectric constant\n(epsilon<=10) turns out to be the 2nd-3rd CPBG. The 2nd-3rd CPBG is the most\nimportant CPBG, because it is the most stable against disorder. For a diamond\nand zinc-blende structure of nonoverlapping dielectric and metallo-dielectric\nspheres, a CPBG begins to decrease with an increasing dielectric contrast\nroughly at the point where another CPBG starts to open--a kind of gap\ncompetition. A CPBG can even shrink to zero when the dielectric contrast\nincreases further. Metal inclusions have the biggest effect for the dielectric\nconstant 2<=epsilon<=12, which is a typical dielectric constant at near\ninfrared and in the visible for many materials, including semiconductors and\npolymers. It is shown that one can create a sizeable and robust 2nd-3rd CPBG at\nnear infrared and visible wavelengths even for a photonic crystal which is\ncomposed of more than 97% low refractive index materials (n<=1.45, i.e., that\nof silica glass or a polymer). These findings open the door for any\nsemiconductor and polymer material to be used as genuine building blocks for\nthe creation of photonic crystals with a CPBG and significantly increase the\npossibilities for experimentalists to realize a sizeable and robust CPBG in the\nnear infrared and in the visible. One possibility is a construction method\nusing optical tweezers, which is analyzed here.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Sep 2002 13:31:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This formula can also be extended to the\ncase of $q$-deformations of tensor product multiplicities as recently\nconjectured by Hatayama et al. (math.QA/9812022 and math.QA/0102113). In its\noriginal formulation it is difficult to compute the fermionic formula\nefficiently. Kleber (q-alg/9611032 and math.QA/9809087) found an algorithm for\nthe simply-laced algebras which overcomes this problem. We present a method\nwhich reduces all other cases to the simply-laced case using embeddings of\naffine algebras. This is the fermionic analogue of the virtual crystal\nconstruction by the authors, which is the realization of crystal graphs for\narbitrary quantum affine algebras in terms of those of simply-laced type.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Sep 2002 10:05:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Apr 2014 00:26:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-11"}
