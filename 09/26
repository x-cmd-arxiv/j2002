The regime is predicted\nto occur if the magnetospheric radius larger than the corotation radius and\nless than the light cylinder radius. The simulations show that accreting\nmatters is expelled from the equatorial region of the magnetosphere and that it\nmoves away from the star in a supersonic, disk-shaped outflow. At larger radial\ndistances the outflow slows down and becomes subsonic. The equatorial matter\noutflow is initially driven by the centrifugal force, but at larger distances\nthe pressure gradient becomes significant.

It might have taken place within the system of the\nmost massive galaxies of the Local Group (LG) at the earliest stages of their\nformation and evolution. We argue that the origin and basic characteristics of\nthe SPGCs can naturally be explained as a result of mass outflow from M31,\nduring and due to formation of its Pop. II stars, and subsequent accretion of\ngas onto its massive companions, the Galaxy and M33. An amount of the gas\naccreted onto the Milky Way is expected to have been quite enough for the\nformation in the outer Galactic halo not only of the clusters under\nconsideration but also a number of those dSph galaxies which are as young as\nthe SPGCs.

We argue that the limit of no\n(or small) brane-localized kinetic term for bulk gauge field on the RS side\n(often studied in the literature) is dual to no bare kinetic term for the gauge\nfield which is coupled to the CFT global current. In this limit, the kinetic\nterm for this gauge field in the dual CFT is ``induced'' by CFT loops. Then,\nthis CFT loop contribution to the gauge field 1PI two-point function is dual\n(on the RS side) to the full gauge propagator (i.e., including the contribution\nof Kaluza-Klein and zero-modes) with both external points on the Planck brane.\nWe also emphasize that loop corrections to the gauge coupling on the RS side\nare dual to sub-leading effects in a large-N expansion on the CFT side; these\nsub-leading corrections to the gauge coupling in the dual CFT are (in general)\nsensitive to the strong dynamics of the CFT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Sep 2002 18:05:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2002 20:59:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

This\npaper is concerned with the asymptotic behaviour of\n$\\Ass_{R_0}(H^i_{R_+}(M)_n)$ as $n \\to -\\infty$.\n  The smallest $i$ for which such study is interesting is the finiteness\ndimension $f$ of $M$ relative to $R_+$, defined as the least integer $j$ for\nwhich $H^j_{R_+}(M)$ is not finitely generated.

The proof is general and valid for arbitrary system\nwhether it be atomic, molecular, or solid state, and for arbitrary state and\nsymmetry. This then provides justification for all prior work in the literature\nbased on the assumption of finiteness of this potential energy at a nucleus. We\nfurther demonstrate the criticality of the electron-nucleus cusp condition to\nsuch theories by example of the Hydrogen molecule.
