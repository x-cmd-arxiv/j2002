In pulsars with super-critical magnetic fields, some more exotic\nprocesses, such as magnetic photon splitting and bound pair formation, will\nalso play noticeable roles. All these effects should be synthesized to discuss\nradio pulsar death both in the conventional long-period regime due to the\nturnoff of the active gap, and in the high magnetic field regime due to the\npossible suppression of the free pair formation.

The spectral redistribution\nfunction and the detection efficiency are well-characterized at energies from\n1.5 to 8.0 keV. The calibration at energies below 1.5 keV is challenging\nbecause of the lack of strong lines in the calibration source and also because\nof the inherent non-linear dependence with energy of the CTI and the absorption\nby the contamination layer.

At early times, densities are sufficiently high and cooling times\nsufficiently short that abundant quantities of star-forming gas are present in\nall dark matter halos that can cool by atomic processes. Consequently, the star\nformation density generically rises exponentially as z decreases, independent\nof the details of the physical model for star formation, but dependent on the\nnormalisation and shape of the cosmological power spectrum. This part of the\nevolution is dominated by gravitationally driven growth of the halo mass\nfunction.

We show that the necessary conditions for\nthese effects to be observable are realized in a three-level $\\Lambda$-system\ninteracting with a linearly polarized laser beam in the presence of a static\nmagnetic field. In low power regime, when all other nonlinear processes are\nnegligible, the light-induced Zeeman coherence cancels the resonant absorption\nof the medium almost completely, but preserves the dispersion anomalous and\nvery high. As a result, a superluminal light pulse propagation can be observed\nin the sense that the peak of the transmitted pulse exits the medium before the\npeak of the incident pulse enters. There is no violation of causality and\nenergy conservation. Moreover, the superluminal effects are prominently\nmanifested in the reshaping of pulse, which is caused by the\nintensity-dependent pulse velocity. Unlike the shock wave formation in a\nnonlinear medium with normal dispersion, here, the self-steepening of the pulse\ntrailing edge takes place due to the fact that the more intense parts of the\npulse travel slower. The predicted effect can be easily observed in the well\nknown schemes employed for studying of nonlinear magneto-optical rotation.

Whereas in the traditional V cycle the residue is passed to the\ncoarser grid levels, this new scheme does not require the calculation of a\nresidue.
