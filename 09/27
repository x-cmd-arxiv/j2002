A 0.7 square-degree imager\ncomprised of 36 large format fully-depleted n-type CCD's sharing a focal plane\nwith 36 HgCdTe detectors forms the heart of SNAP, allowing discovery and\nlightcurve measurements simultaneously for many supernovae. The imager and a\nhigh-efficiency low-resolution integral field spectrograph are coupled to a 2-m\nthree mirror anastigmat wide-field telescope, which will be placed in a\nhigh-earth orbit. The SNAP mission can obtain high-signal-to-noise calibrated\nlight-curves and spectra for over 2000 Type Ia supernovae at redshifts between\nz=0.1 and 1.7. The resulting data set can not only determine the amount of dark\nenergy with high precision, but test the nature of the dark energy by examining\nits equation of state. In particular, dark energy due to a cosmological\nconstant can be differentiated from alternatives such as \"quintessence\", by\nmeasuring the dark energy's equation of state to an accuracy of +/-0.05, and by\nstudying its time dependence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2002 16:46:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

This results implies considerably\nlonger disc lifetimes than found in some recent studies of other young stellar\nclusters. For the classical T Tauri (CTT) and weak-lined T Tauri (WTT) star\npopulation, we also find a strong correlation between the IR excess and H_alpha\nemission. The IR excesses of these stars indicate a wide range of star-disc\nactivity; from a CTT star showing high levels of accretion, to CTT - WTT\ntransition objects with evidence for some on-going accretion, and WTT stars\nwith weak or absent IR excesses. Of the 15 known cluster members, 4 stars with\nIR excesses delta(K-L) > 0.4 mag are likely experiencing on-going accretion\nowing to strong or variable optical emission. The resulting accretion fraction\n(0.27 pm 0.13; 2_sigma) shows that the accretion phase, in addition to the\ndiscs themselves, can endure for at least ~10 Myr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Sep 2002 06:15:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The\npurpose of this paper is to address the main weakness of the Smagorinsky model,\nits poor performance near the wall. The goal is to establish a model that\ncorrects the Smagorinsky model near the walls while at the same time minimizing\nthe computational overhead. A version the Dynamic Subgrid Scale model is also\nincorporated into the finite element code to facilitate comparisons with the\nnew model near the walls.\n  One of the unique characteristics of Large Eddy Simulations as compared to\nother methods of dealing with turbulent flows is the idea of filtering. In this\npaper we define what a filter is and also address an issue related to filters;\nthe error that results when the filtering and differential operations are\ninterchanged. This error is studied under the context of the Finite Element\nMethod which allows us to focus on the function being filtered rather than the\nfilter kernal function, which has been the usual approach in studying this\nerror.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2002 20:56:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Sep 2002 22:57:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

For\nthe simplest class of protocols (non-aborting and with complete and perfect\nverification), it is shown how naturally a game-theoretical situation arises.\nFor these protocols, bounds for the cheating probabilities are derived, which\nturn out to be different from those given in the impossibility proof. The whole\nclassification and analysis has been carried out using a \"finite open system\"\napproach. The discrepancy with the impossibility proof is explained on the\nbasis of the implicit adoption of a \"closed system approach\"--equivalent to\nmodeling the commitment as performed by two fixed machines interacting\nunitarily in a overall \"closed system\". However, it is shown that the closed\nsystem approach for the classification of commitment protocols unavoidably\nleads to infinite dimensions, which then invalidate the continuity argument at\nthe basis of the impossibility proof.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2002 21:38:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
