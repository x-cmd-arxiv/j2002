The RG flow of $P(G)$\nat energies away from the transition yielded the value of the critical\nexponent, $\\nu$, that agreed with most accurate large-size lattice simulations.\nTo obtain the information about the level statistics from the RG approach, we\nanalyze the evolution of the distribution of {\\em phases} of the {\\em\namplitude} transmission coefficient upon a step of the RG transformation. From\nthe fixed point of this transformation we extract the critical level spacing\ndistribution (LSD).

Studying the change of\nthe LSD around the QH transition, we check that it indeed obeys scaling\nbehavior. This enables us to use the alternative approach to extracting the\ncritical exponent, based on the LSD, and to find $\\nu=2.37\\pm0.02$ very close\nto the value established in the literature.

The pleating invariants of a component of\n$\\bch$ consist of the projective class of its bending measure, together with\nthe lamination length of a fixed choice of transverse measure in this class.\nOur description complements that of Minsky in \\cite{MinskyPT}, in which he\ndescribes the space of all punctured torus groups in terms of {\\em ending\ninvariants} which characterize the asymptotic geometry of the ends of $M$.\n  Pleating invariants give a quasifuchsian analog of the Kerckhoff-Thurston\ndescription of Fuchsian space by critical lines and earthquake horocycles.
