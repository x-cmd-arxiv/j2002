The\nstellar continuum and the absorption line spectrum in the ultraviolet are used\nto constrain the massive stellar population. The strong, blueshifted stellar\nlines of CIV and SiIV detected in the UV spectra indicate a metal-rich,\ncompact, massive (1E6 Msol) cluster of age 3--4 Myr emitting the UV-optical\ncontinuum. We find strong evidence against a depletion of massive stars in this\nmetal-rich cluster. The derived age and the upper mass-limit cut-off of the\ninitial mass function are also consistent with the detection of Wolf-Rayet (WR)\nfeatures at optical wavelengths. As a second independentconstraint on the\nmassive stellar content, the nebular emission-line spectrum is modeled with\nphotoionization codes using stellar spectra from evolutionary synthesis models.\nHowever, the nebular lines are badly reproduced by 3--4 Myr instantaneous\nbursts, as required by the UV line spectrum, when unblanketed WR and/or Kurucz\nstellar atmospheres are used. The corresponding number of photons above 24 and\n54 eV in the synthetic models is too high in comparison with values suggested\nby the observed line ratios. Since the ionizing spectrum in this regime is\ndominated by emission from WR stars, this discrepancy between observations and\nmodels is most likely the result of incorrect assumptions about the WR stars.\nThus we conclude that the nebular spectrum of high-metallicity starbursts is\npoorly reproduced by models for WR dominated populations. However, the new\nmodel set of Smith et al. (2002) with blanketed WR and O atmospheres and\nadjusted WR temperatures predicts a softer far-UV radiation field, providing a\nbetter match to the data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2002 17:23:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

A known systematic bias has been previously used to explain the\nexistence of Class III in terms of Class I; this bias allows the fluences and\ndurations of some bursts to be underestimated (Hakkila et al., ApJ 538, 165,\n2000).

Calculating the ground and first excited many-particle state for five\nelectrons occupying the quantum dot reveals a Stark-induced reordering of\nstates by increasing the electric field strength. It is shown that this\nreordering of states is accompanied by a symmetry change of the local density\nof states (LDOS), which in principal is observable in a wave-function mapping\nexperiment. Since in the usually performed experiments the electric field can\nnot be directly controlled, we investigate the crystal size dependence of the\n5-electron LDOS symmetry. It is found that the symmetry changes from spherical\nto torus-like by increasing the nanocrystal radius.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2002 16:16:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Matrix elements of the\nHamiltonian between these distorted waves are averages over infinite numbers of\nindependent site-energies, and so take definite values rather than\ndistributions of values. The transformed Hamiltonian is ordered, and may be\ninterpreted as an itinerant electron interacting with a spin on each site. In\nthis new basis, the distinction between extended and localized states is clear,\nand edges of the bands of extended states, the mobility edges, are calculated\nas a function of disorder. In two dimensions these edges have been found in\nboth analytic and numerical applications of tridiagonalization, but they have\nnot been found in analytic approaches based on perturbation theory, or the\nsingle-parameter scaling hypothesis; nor have they been detected in numerical\napproaches based on scaling or critical distributions of level spacing. In both\ntwo and three dimensions the mobility edges in this work are found to separate\nwith increasing disorder for all disorders, in contrast with the results of\ncalculation using numerical scaling for three dimensions. The analytic\ntrajectories are compared with recent results of numerical tridiagonalization\non samples of over 10^9 sites. This representation of the Anderson model as an\nordered interacting system implies that in addition to transitions at mobility\nedges, the Anderson model contains weaker transitions characterized by critical\ndisorders where the band of extended states decouples from individual sites;\nand that singularities in the distribution of site energies, rather than its\nsecond moment, determine localization properties of the Anderson model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2002 12:22:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
