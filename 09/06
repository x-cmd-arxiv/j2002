We find that Earth class planets can grow around Alpha Cen A on\na time-scale of 50 Myr. In some of our numerical models the planets form\ndirectly in the habitable zone of the star in low eccentric orbits. In one\nsimulation two of the final planets are in a 2:1 mean motion resonance that,\nhowever, becomes unstable after 200 Myr. During the formation process some\nplanetary embryos fall into the stars possibly altering their metallicity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Sep 2002 15:08:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

From the mean durations $\\tauphi$ of visits to\nMBs, we derive effective depths of these objects by the relation\n$\\Eapp=\\d\\ln\\tauphi/\\d\\beta$, where $\\beta=1/\\kB T$. Since the apparent\nactivation energies $\\Eapp$ are of purely dynamical origin, we look for a\nquantitative relation to PEL structure. A consequence of the rugged nature of\nMBs is that escapes from MBs are not single hops between PEL minima, but\ncomplicated multi-minima sequences. We introduce the concept of return\nprobabilities to the bottom of MBs in order to judge whether the attraction\nrange of a MB was left. We then compute the energy barriers that were\nsurmounted.

The third extremum configuration is the saddle point\nseparating these minima. It is also called the transition state for\nmagnetization reversal.

Gossiping\nexhibits bimodal behavior in sufficiently large networks: in some executions,\nthe gossip dies out quickly and hardly any node gets the message; in the\nremaining executions, a substantial fraction of the nodes gets the message. The\nfraction of executions in which most nodes get the message depends on the\ngossiping probability and the topology of the network.

In this paper, we give a detailed analysis of\na cone-based distributed topology control algorithm. This algorithm, introduced\nin [16], does not assume that nodes have GPS information available; rather it\ndepends only on directional information. Roughly speaking, the basic idea of\nthe algorithm is that a node $u$ transmits with the minimum power\n$p_{u,\\alpha}$ required to ensure that in every cone of degree $\\alpha$ around\n$u$, there is some node that $u$ can reach with power $p_{u,\\alpha}$.

A multiyear NASA-funded study at the Lockheed Martin Advanced\nTechnology Center further developed this concept, resulting in an independent\ntheoretical validation of the fundamental approach (Rueda and Haisch, 1998ab).\nDistortion of the quantum vacuum in accelerated reference frames results in a\nforce that appears to account for inertia.

The evolution equations guarantee that the\nevolved variables will satisfy the constraints at later instants of time. This\nis only true within the domain of dependence of the initial data. If one wishes\nto consider situations where the evolutions are studied for longer intervals\nthan the size of the domain of dependence, as is usually the case in three\ndimensional numerical relativity, one needs to give boundary data. The boundary\ndata should be specified in such a way that the constraints are satisfied\neverywhere, at all times. In this paper we address this problem for the case of\ngeneral relativity linearized around Minkowski space using the generalized\nEinstein-Christoffel symmetric hyperbolic system of evolution equations. We\nstudy the evolution equations for the constraints, specify boundary conditions\nfor them that make them well posed and further choose these boundary conditions\nin such a way that the evolution equations for the metric variables are also\nwell posed. We also consider the case of a manifold with a non-smooth boundary,\nas is the usual case of the cubic boxes commonly used in numerical relativity.\nThe techniques discussed should be applicable to more general cases, as\nlinearizations around more complicated backgrounds, and may be used to\nestablish well posedness in the full non-linear case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2002 20:55:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The general concept of z-scaling is\napplied for the analysis of pi-p and pi-A experimental data on the inclusive\ncross section. The scaling function psi(z) and scaling variable z are\nconstructed and the anomalous dimension delta_pi is found. The A-dependence of\nparticle production in pion-nucleus collisions is studied. The predictions of\nthe inclusive cross section of the pi0-mesons produced in pi-A collisions in\nthe central rapidity range at high energies have been made.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Sep 2002 10:08:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
