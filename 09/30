This so-called cold dark matter (CDM) crisis has\nbeen addressed in several ways, ranging from a change in fundamental physics by\nintroducing self-interacting cold dark matter particles to a tuning of complex\nastrophysical processes such as global and/or local feedback. All these efforts\nattempt to soften density profiles and reduce the abundance of satellites in\nsimulated galaxy halos. In this contribution we are exploring the differences\nbetween a Warm Dark Matter model and a CDM model where the power on a certain\nscale is reduced by introducing a narrow negative feature (''dip''). This dip\nis placed in a way so as to mimic the loss of power in the WDM model: both\nmodels have the same integrated power out to the scale where the power of the\nDip model rises to the level of the unperturbed CDM spectrum again. Using\nN-body simulations we show that that the new Dip model appears to be a viable\nalternative to WDM while being based on different physics: where WDM requires\nthe introduction of a new particle species the Dip stems from a non-standard\ninflationary period. If we are looking for an alternative to the currently\nchallenged standard LCDM structure formation scenario, neither the LWDM nor the\nnew Dip model can be ruled out with respect to the analysis presented in this\ncontribution. They both make very similar predictions and the degeneracy\nbetween them can only be broken with observations yet to come.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Sep 2002 01:25:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

This is\nobtained via the classical action integral which is solely a boundary term. On\ndiscretising the classical action, the quantum amplitude can be expressed in\nterms of generalised coherent states of the harmonic oscillator. A\nsqueezed-state representation is obtained by complexifying the proper time\nseparation T at spatial infinity between the initial and final space-like\nhypersurfaces. Such a procedure is deemed necessary as the two-surface problem\nfor Dirichlet boundary data and wave-like perturbations is not well posed. We\nfind that infinitesimal rotation into the lower complex T plane is equivalent\nto a highly-squeezed final state for the relic radiation, similar to the relic\ngravitational-wave background in cosmology. This final state is a pure state,\nand so the unpredictability associated with the final momentarily-naked\nsingularity is avoided. The cosmological analogy is the tunnelling from an\ninitial smooth Euclidean or timeless state to a classical universe. The\nhigh-squeezing limit corresponds to a final state of the Hawking flux which is\nindistinguishable from a stochastic collection of standing waves.
