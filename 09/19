(Abridged) We demonstrate that the inner region of UMi is\nsignificantly structured, at odds with what expected for a system in dynamical\nequilibrium. In particular we show that the main density peak of UMi is\noff-centered with respect to the center of symmetry of the whole galaxy and it\nshows a much lower ellipticity with respect to the rest of the galaxy.\nMoreover, UMi stars are shown to be clustered according to two different\ncharacteristic clustering scales, as opposite to Draco, which instead has a\nvery symmetric and smooth density profile. The possible consequences of this\nstriking structural difference on our ideas about galaxy formation are briefly\ndiscussed. Combining our distance modulus with the more recent estimates of the\ntotal luminosity of UMi, we find that the mass to light (M/L) ratio of this\ngalaxy may be as low as M/L ~ 7, a factor 5-10 lower than current estimates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Sep 2002 08:38:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Many experiments are now in progress whose aim is detecting\nanisotropy and polarization of the CMB.

This is similar\nto conformal motions. There are however some exceptions that yield infinite\ndimensional algebras in any dimension of the manifold. We also show that\nKerr-Schild motions may be interpreted as some kind of metric symmetries in the\nsense of having associated some geometrical invariants. In the second part, we\nsuggest a scheme able to cope with other new candidates of metric motions from\na geometrical viewpoint.

An application to 24Mg, using the realistic two-body\ninteraction of Wildenthal, is used to explore the validity of this mixed-mode\nshell-model scheme. Specifically, the correct binding energy (within 2% of the\nfull-space result) as well as low-energy configurations that have greater than\n90% overlap with full-space results are obtained in a space that spans less\nthan 10% of the full-space. The theory is also applied to lower pf-shell\nnuclei, 44Ti-48Ti and 48Cr, using the Kuo-Brown-3 interaction. These nuclei\nshow strong SU(3) symmetry breaking due mainly to the single-particle\nspin-orbit splitting. Nevertheless, the results also show that yrast band B(E2)\nvalues are insensitive to fragmentation of the SU(3) symmetry. Specifically,\nthe quadrupole collectivity as measured by B(E2) strengths remains high even\nthough the SU(3) symmetry is rather badly broken.
