Electron beam energy spectra as\nwell as positive-ion-beam energy spectra and profiles are shown. A change in\nthe crystal temperature of 100oC will cause a spontaneous change in\npolarization. The change in polarization will be manifested by a change in\ncharge on the surface of the crystal.

The source of\nthe accelerated electrons or positive ions is gas molecules ionized near the\ncrystal surface. When the crystal surface is negative electrons are accelerated\naway from it and positive ions are attracted to the surface.
