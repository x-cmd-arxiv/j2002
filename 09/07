Repeated X-ray flaring is found in PDS 456, over\nthe duration of the 340 ksec long Beppo-SAX observation. The X-ray flux doubles\nin just 30 ksec, whilst the total energy output of the flaring events is as\nhigh as 10^51 erg. Under the assumption of isotropic emission at the Eddington\nlimit, this implies that the size of the X-ray emitting region in PDS 456 is\nless than 3 Schwarzschild radii, for a 10^9 solar mass black hole. From the\nrates of change of luminosity observed during the X-ray flares, we calculate\nlower limits for the radiative efficiency between 0.06 and 0.41, implying that\naccretion onto a Kerr black hole is likely in PDS 456. We suggest that the\nrapid variability is from X-ray flares produced through magnetic reconnection\nabove the disc and calculate that the energetics and timescale of the flares\nare plausible if the quasar is accreting near to the maximum Eddington rate. A\nsimilar mechanism may account for the extreme rapid X-ray variability observed\nin many Narrow Line Seyfert 1s. In the case of PDS 456, we show that the X-ray\nflaring could be reproduced through a self-induced cascade of about 1000\nindividual flares over a timescale of the order 1 day.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Sep 2002 16:41:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

It has been\nnoticed by various authors that this nonlinear field overcomes the well known\ninconsistency of the theory for a linear massive spin-two field interacting\nwith Einstein's gravity. Starting from a Lagrangian quadratically depending on\nthe Ricci tensor of the metric, we explore the two possible second-order\npictures usually called \"(Helmholtz-)Jordan frame\" and \"Einstein frame\". In\nspite of their mathematical equivalence, the two frames have different\nstructural properties: in Einstein frame, the spin-two field is minimally\ncoupled to gravity, while in the other frame it is necessarily coupled to the\ncurvature, without a separate kinetic term. We prove that the theory admits a\nunique and linearly stable ground state solution, and that the equations of\nmotion are consistent, showing that these results can be obtained independently\nin either frame. The full equations of motion and the energy-momentum tensor\nfor the spin--two field in Einstein frame are given, and a simple but\nnontrivial exact solution to these equations is found. The comparison of the\nenergy-momentum tensors for the spin-two field in the two frames suggests that\nthe Einstein frame is physically more acceptable. We point out that the\nenergy-momentum tensor generated by the Lagrangian of the linearized theory is\nunrelated to the corresponding tensor of the full theory. It is then argued\nthat the ghost-like nature of the nonlinear spin-two field, found long ago in\nthe linear approximation, may not be so harmful to classical stability issues,\nas has been expected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Sep 2002 10:25:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Precisely\ndefined averaging operations are required to obtain exact averaged equations.\nEnsemble, temporal, and spatial averages are all considered because they\nproduce different statistical equations and because they apply to theoretical\npurposes, experiment, and numerical simulation of turbulence. Particularly\nsimple exact equations are obtained for the following cases: i) the trace of\nthe structure functions, ii) DNS that has periodic boundary conditions, and\niii) an average over a sphere in r-space. The last case (iii) introduces the\naverage over orientations of r into the structure function equations. The\nenergy dissipation rate appears in the exact trace equation without averaging,\nwhereas in previous formulations energy dissipation rate appears after\naveraging and use of local isotropy. The trace mitigates the effect of\nanisotropy in the equations, thereby revealing that the trace of the\nthird-order structure function is expected to be superior for quantifying\nasymptotic scaling laws.
