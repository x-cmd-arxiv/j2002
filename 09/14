It is also\nevident in the use of lensing magnification by galaxy clusters in order to\nreach faint submm/mm continuum sources. There are, however, a few cases where\nmillimeter lines have been directly involved in understanding lensing\nconfigurations. Future mm/submm instruments, such as the ALMA interferometer,\nwill have both the sensitivity and the angular resolution to allow detailed\nobservations of gravitational lenses. The almost constant sensitivity to dust\nemission over the redshift range z=1-10 means that the likelihood for strong\nlensing of dust continuum sources is much higher than for optically selected\nsources. A large number of new strong lenses are therefore likely to be\ndiscovered with ALMA, allowing a direct assessment of cosmological parameters\nthrough lens statistics. Combined with an angular resolution <0.1\", ALMA will\nalso be efficient for probing the gravitational potential of galaxy clusters,\nwhere we will be able to study both the sources and the lenses themselves, free\nof obscuration and extinction corrections, derive rotation curves for the\nlenses, their orientation and, thus, greatly constrain lens models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Sep 2002 17:59:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The gates\nare static in the sense that they contribute Hamiltonian 0 and hold as\nconstants of the motion; only the wires are dynamic. Just as a spin 1/2 makes\nan ideal 1-bit memory element, a spin 1 makes an ideal 3-bit gate. Such gates\ncost no computation time: relaxing the wires alone solves the network. We\ncompare computation time with that of an easier Boolean network where all the\ngate constraints are simply removed. This computation model is robust with\nrespect to decoherence and yields a generalized quantum speed-up for all NP\nproblems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Sep 2002 17:51:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The usual\n(equilibrium) detailed balance condition is characterized by the property that\nthis constant is identically zero.
