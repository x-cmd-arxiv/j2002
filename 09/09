Low-frequency electromagnetic plasma waves excited by the\nElectron Firehose Instability (EFI) can account for the acceleration of ions up\nto 1 MeV/amu energies as a single stage process. The EFI arises as a direct\nconsequence of the free energy stored in a temperature anisotropy\n(T_parallel>T_perp) of the bulk energized electron population during the\nacceleration process. In contrast to other mechanisms which require special\nplasma properties, the EFI is an intrinsic feature of the acceleration process\nof the bulk electrons. Being present as a side effect in the flaring plasma,\nthese waves can account for the acceleration of 3He and 4He while selectively\nenhancing 3He due to the spectral energy density built up from linear growth.\nLinearized kinetic theory, analytic models and test-particle simulations have\nbeen applied to investigate the ability of the waves to accelerate and\nfractionate. As waves grow in both directions parallel to the magnetic field,\nthey can trap resonant ions and efficiently accelerate them to the highest\nenergies. Plausible models have been found that can explain the observed\nenergies, spectra and abundances of 3He and 4He.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Sep 2002 16:38:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Using a simple collapse model and cooling criterion, we\ndetermine which halos are able to form stars before being disrupted by mergers.\nWe contrast the mass functions of all the resulting star clusters and those of\nprimordial composition, i.e. star clusters that have not been contaminated by\nsubclusters inside them. In confirmation of previous work, two generations of\nprimordial star clusters are identified: low-temperature clusters that cool via\nmolecular hydrogen, and high-temperature clusters that cool via electronic\ntransitions. The former dominate by number, but the two populations contain a\nsimilar mass with the precise balance depending upon the details of the model.\nWe speculate on the current-day distribution of Population III stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2002 13:39:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The absorbers in 0943-242 exhibit\nlittle additional structure compared with previous low-resolution spectroscopy\nand the main absorber is still consistent with HI column density of ~10^19\ncm^-2.

However, the main absorbers in 0200+015\nare very different.

We propose a technique that would allow time resolution up to\nfemtosecond capabilities to be recovered from a long (100 ps) X-ray probe\npulse. The visible pump pulse must be as short as the desired time resolution.\nThe principle of operation of the proposed pump-probe scheme is essentially\nbased on the statistical properties of the synchrotron radiation. These\nproperties are well known in statistical optics as properties of completely\nchaotic polarized light. Our technique utilizes the fact that, for any\nsynchrotron light beam there exist some characteristic time (coherence time),\nwhich determines the time-scale of the random fluctuations. The typical\ncoherence time of soft X-ray synchrotron light at the exit of monochromator is\nin the femtosecond range. An excited state is prepared with a pump pulse and\nthen projected with a probe pulse onto a final ion state. The first statistical\nquantity of interest is the variance of the number of photoelectrons detected\nduring synchrotron radiation pulse. The statistics of concern are defined over\nan ensemble of synchrotron radiation pulses. From a set of variances measured\nas a function of coherence time (inversely proportional to monochromator\nbandwidth) it is possible to reconstruct the femtosecond dynamical process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Sep 2002 21:08:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
