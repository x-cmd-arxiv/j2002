Many properties of binary fluid\nconvection are then consequences of generic properties of 2 x 2 matrices. The\neigenvalues of 2 x 2 matrices varying continuously with a parameter r undergo\neither avoided crossing or complex coalescence, depending on the sign of the\ncoupling (product of off-diagonal terms). We first consider the matrix\ngoverning the stability of the conductive state. When the thermal and solutal\ngradients act in concert (S>0, avoided crossing), the growth rates of\nperturbations remain real and of either thermal or solutal type. In contrast,\nwhen the thermal and solutal gradients are of opposite signs (S<0, complex\ncoalescence), the growth rates become complex and are of mixed type.\nSurprisingly, the kinetic energy of nonlinear steady states is governed by an\neigenvalue problem very similar to that governing the growth rates. There is a\nquantitative analogy between the growth rates of the linear stability problem\nfor infinite Prandtl number and the amplitudes of steady states of the minimal\nfive-variable Veronis model for arbitrary Prandtl number. For positive S,\navoided crossing leads to a distinction between low-amplitude solutal and\nhigh-amplitude thermal regimes. For negative S, the transition between real and\ncomplex eigenvalues leads to the creation of branches of finite amplitude, i.e.\nto saddle-node bifurcations. The codimension-two point at which the saddle-node\nbifurcations disappear, separating subcritical from supercritical pitchfork\nbifurcations, is exactly analogous to the Bogdanov codimension-two point at\nwhich the Hopf bifurcations disappear in the linear problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 2002 16:14:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

By\napplying a Cartan decomposition to su(4), we find that the geometric structure\nof non-local gates is a 3-Torus. We derive the invariants for local\ntransformations, and connect these local invariants to the coordinates of the\n3-Torus. Since different points on the 3-Torus may correspond to the same local\nequivalence class, we use the Weyl group theory to reduce the symmetry. We show\nthat the local equivalence classes of two-qubit gates are in one-to-one\ncorrespondence with the points in a tetrahedron except on the base. We then\nstudy the properties of perfect entanglers, that is, the two-qubit operations\nthat can generate maximally entangled states from some initially separable\nstates. We provide criteria to determine whether a given two-qubit gate is a\nperfect entangler and establish a geometric description of perfect entanglers\nby making use of the tetrahedral representation of non-local gates. We find\nthat exactly half the non-local gates are perfect entanglers. We also\ninvestigate the non-local operations generated by a given Hamiltonian. We first\nstudy the gates that can be directly generated by a Hamiltonian. Then we\nexplicitly construct a quantum circuit that contains at most three non-local\ngates generated by a two-body interaction Hamiltonian, together with at most\nfour local gates generated by single qubit terms. We prove that such a quantum\ncircuit can simulate any arbitrary two-qubit gate exactly, and hence it\nprovides an efficient implementation of universal quantum computation and\nsimulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Sep 2002 00:24:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Sep 2002 22:19:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-22"}

The emphasis is put on the very special\ncorrelations that this theory makes possible: they are forbidden by very\ngeneral arguments based on realism and local causality. In fact, these\ncorrelations are completely impossible in any circumstance, except the very\nspecial situations designed by physicists especially to observe these purely\nquantum effects. Another general point that is emphasized is the necessity for\nthe theory to predict the emergence of a single result in a single realization\nof an experiment. For this purpose, orthodox quantum mechanics introduces a\nspecial postulate: the reduction of the state vector, which comes in addition\nto the Schrodinger evolution postulate. Nevertheless, the presence in parallel\nof two evolution processes of the same object (the state vector) maybe a\npotential source for conflicts; various attitudes that are possible to avoid\nthis problem are discussed in this text. After a brief historical introduction,\nrecalling how the very special status of the state vector has emerged in\nquantum mechanics, various conceptual difficulties are introduced and\ndiscussed. The Einstein Podolsky Rosen (EPR) theorem is presented with the help\nof a botanical parable, in a way that emphasizes how deeply the EPR reasoning\nis rooted into what is often called \"scientific method''.
