For this purpose, we examine the magnetic reconnection triggered\nby Parker instability (magnetic buoyancy instability), by performing the\ntwo-dimensional resistive numerical magnetohydrodynamic simulations. As a\nresult of numerical simulations, the system evolves as following phases: Parker\ninstability occurs in the Galactic disk. In the nonlinear phase of Parker\ninstability, the magnetic loop inflates from the Galactic disk into the\nGalactic halo, and collides with the anti-parallel magnetic field, so that the\ncurrent sheets are created in the Galactic halo. The tearing instability\noccurs, and creates the plasmoids (magnetic islands). Just after the plasmoid\nejection, further current-sheet thinning occurs in the sheet, and the anomalous\nresistivity sets in. Petschek reconnection starts, and heats the gas quickly in\nthe Galactic halo. It also creates the slow and fast shock regions in the\nGalactic halo. The magnetic field ($B\\sim 3 \\mu$G), for example, can heat the\ngas ($n\\sim 10^{-3}$ cm$^{-3}$) to temperature of $\\sim 10^6$ K via the\nreconnection in the Galactic halo. The gas is accelerated to Alfv\\'en velocity\n($\\sim 300$ km s$^{-1}$). Such high velocity jets are the evidence of the\nGalactic flare model we present in this paper, if the Doppler shift of the\nbipolar jet is detected in the Galactic halo.

Here I show that the set of\norientations of $G$ having the same flow-differences around all closed loops\ncan be given the structure of a distributive lattice. The construction\ngeneralizes partial orderings that arise in the study of alternating sign\nmatrices. It also gives rise to lattices for the set of degree-constrained\nfactors of a bipartite planar graph; as special cases, one obtains lattices\nthat arise in the study of plane partitions and domino tilings. Lastly, the\ntheory gives a lattice structure to the set of spanning trees of a planar\ngraph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Sep 2002 07:13:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 May 2020 21:14:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 19 Mar 2021 17:15:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-22"}

The model describes, e.g., a\ntwo-layer liquid film flowing down an inclined plane. It has been recently\nshown that the system supports stable solitary pulses. We demonstrate that a\nperturbation analysis, based on the balance equation for the field momentum,\npredicts the existence of stable cnoidal waves (CnWs) in the same system. It is\nfound that the mean value U of the wave field u in the main subsystem, but not\nthe mean value of the extra field, affects the stability of the periodic waves.\nThree different areas can be distinguished inside the stability region in the\nparameter plane (L,U), where L is the wave's period. In these areas, stable\nare, respectively, CnWs with positive velocity, constant solutions, and CnWs\nwith negative velocity. Multistability, i.e., the coexistence of several\nattractors, including the waves with several maxima per period, appears at\nlarge value of L. The analytical predictions are completely confirmed by direct\nsimulations. Stable waves are also found numerically in the limit of vanishing\ndispersion, when the KS-KdV equation goes over into the KS one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Sep 2002 09:55:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
