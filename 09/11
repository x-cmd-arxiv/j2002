Therefore, it is\nworthwhile to analyze associative memory models with delayed synapses. Thus, a\nsequential associative memory model with delayed synapses is discussed, where a\ndiscrete synchronous updating rule and a correlation learning rule are\nemployed. Its dynamic properties are analyzed by the statistical neurodynamics.\nIn this paper, we first re-derive the Yanai-Kim theory, which involves\nmacrodynamical equations for the dynamics of the network with serial delay\nelements. Since their theory needs a computational complexity of $O(L^4t)$ to\nobtain the macroscopic state at time step t where L is the length of delay, it\nis intractable to discuss the macroscopic properties for a large L limit. Thus,\nwe derive steady state equations using the discrete Fourier transformation,\nwhere the computational complexity does not formally depend on L. We show that\nthe storage capacity $\\alpha_C$ is in proportion to the delay length L with a\nlarge L limit, and the proportion constant is 0.195, i.e., $\\alpha_C = 0.195\nL$.

In this paper, we extend another classical result of symplectic\ngeometry to real loci: the Kirwan surjectivity theorem. In addition, we compute\nthe kernel of the real Kirwan map. These results are direct consequences of\ntechniques introduced by Tolman and Weitsman. In some examples, these results\nallow us to show that a symplectic reduction $M/ /T$ has the same ordinary\ncohomology as its real locus $(M/ /T)^{\\sigma_{red}}$, with degrees halved.\nThis extends Duistermaat's original result on real loci to a case in which\nthere is not a natural Hamiltonian torus action.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2002 21:42:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Apr 2003 18:15:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 12 May 2004 17:49:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

These\nmacroscopic modeling tasks, yielding information over long time and large space\nscales, are accomplished through appropriately initialized calls to the\nmicroscopic simulator for only short times and small spatial domains. Our\nequation-free (EF) approach, when successful, can bypass the derivation of the\nmacroscopic evolution equations when these equations conceptually exist but are\nnot available in closed form. We discuss how the mathematics-assisted\ndevelopment of a computational superstructure may enable alternative\ndescriptions of the problem physics (e.g. Lattice Boltzmann (LB), kinetic Monte\nCarlo (KMC) or Molecular Dynamics (MD) microscopic simulators, executed over\nrelatively short time and space scales) to perform systems level tasks\n(integration over relatively large time and space scales,\"coarse\" bifurcation\nanalysis, optimization, and control) directly. In effect, the procedure\nconstitutes a systems identification based, \"closure on demand\" computational\ntoolkit, bridging microscopic/stochastic simulation with traditional continuum\nscientific computation and numerical analysis. We illustrate these ideas\nthrough examples from chemical kinetics (LB, KMC), rheology (Brownian\nDynamics), homogenization and the computation of \"coarsely self-similar\"\nsolutions, and discuss various features, limitations and potential extensions\nof the approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2002 21:05:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
