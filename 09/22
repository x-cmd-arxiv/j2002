At millikelvin temperatures,\nthe electron phase coherence length is sufficient that quantum interference\neffects produce reproducible magneto-conductance fluctuations (MCF) that act as\na 'magneto-fingerprint' of the scattering dynamics in the billiard. It has been\npredicted that billiard MCF are fractal. Fractal MCF in mesoscopic\nsemiconductor billiards are investigated experimentally. The MCF of a Sinai\nbilliard displayed exact self-similarity (ESS). A correlation function analysis\nis used to quantify the presence of ESS. A model for the Sinai billiard MCF\nbased on a Weierstrass function is presented. Using a bridging interconnect, a\ncontinuous transition between the Sinai and an empty square geometry is\nachieved. The removal of the circle induces a transition from ESS to\nstatistical self-similarity (SSS), suggesting that ESS is due to the presence\nof an obstacle at the center of the billiard. The physical dependencies of SSS\nare investigated and show variation in the fractal dimension, rather than the\nfractal scaling range. SSS obeys a unified picture where the fractal dimension\ndepends only on the ratio between the average spacing and broadening of\nbilliard energy levels, irrespective of other billiard parameters. The\nsemiclassical origin of SSS is demonstrated and the suppression of SSS is\nobserved in both the quantum and classical limits.
