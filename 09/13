Thus, if indeed the CRF\nclimate connection is real, the increased CRF witnessed while crossing the\nspiral arms could be responsible for a larger global cloud cover and a reduced\ntemperature, thereby facilitating the occurrences of ice ages.

To this goal, we first solve the Schroedinger and\nthen the Kohn-Sham equations for an ion immersed in a dense plasma under\nconditions for which the mean interparticle distance is smaller than the Debye\nradius.

As a consequence, the predicted rate of the\nBe7 + e- reaction is reduced by 20-30%, depending on the exact solar model.\nSince Be7 is a trace element, its total production is controlled by the\nunchanged He4+He3 reaction rate, and its destruction is determined by the rate\nof electron capture. As the latter rate decreases when the Beryllium is fully\nionized (relative to the case of partially ionized Be), the estimate for the\nabundance of Be7 increases and with it the B8 neutrino flux. The increase in\nphi_nu(B8) is by about 20-30%.

The method is based on the\nDarvin's evolutionary theory: structures with lowest energies survive in a\nsystem of fixed number of clusters. Two existing structures from a given\npopulation are combined in a special way to produce a new structure (child)\nwhich is kept if its energy is lower than the highest energy in the ensemble.\nTo keep the population constant we reject the structure with the highest\nenergy. This algorithm gives a better result than the optimization techniques\nused previously. Using the GA we have found a new structure corresponding to\nthe (seemingly) global minimum. The most important result is that the new\nstructure is detected only if the molecular cluster contains more than a\ncritical number of molecules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Sep 2002 15:36:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
