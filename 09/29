From the elementary particle point\nof view it pops up in almost every model. giving rise, among others, to the\nfollowing mechanisms: a) The traditional contributions like the light neutrino\nmass mechanism . b) The exotic R-parity violating supersymmetric (SUSY)\ncontributions. Similar considerations apply to its sister lepton and muon\nnumber violating muon to positron conversion. The observation of neutrinoless\ndouble beta decay will signal that the neutrinos are massive Majorana\nparticles. For nuclear physics it is challenging, because: 1) The nuclei, which\ncan undergo double beta decay, have complicated structure. 2) The energetically\nallowed transitions are suppressed. 3) One must cope with the short distance\nbehavior of the transition operators. Thus novel effects (decay of pions in\nflight between nucleons etc) have to be considered. 4) One has to take into\naccount possible momentum dependent terms of the nucleon current.

Symmetric words in positive definite\nA and B are positive definite, and so for fxed B, we can view a symmetric word,\nS(A,B), as a map from the set of positive definite matrices into itself. Given\npositive definite P, B, and a symmetric word, S(A,B), with positive powers of\nA, we defne a symmetric word equation as an equation of the form S(A,B) = P.\nSuch an equation is solvable if there is always a positive definite solution A\nfor any given B and P. We prove that all symmetric word equations are solvable.\nApplications of this fact, methods for solution, questions about unique\nsolvability (injectivity), and generalizations are also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Sep 2002 09:21:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In the spectral region, where the diffraction of\ngenerated waves is essential, the radiation manifests itself in the coherent\ninterference of CR and UR.
