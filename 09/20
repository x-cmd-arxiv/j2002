In the string field theory context, we first develop a general\nformalism to analyze open strings in gauge trivial closed string backgrounds,\nand then apply it both to the RNS string and within Berkovits' covariant\nformalism, where the results have the most natural interpretation. The most\nremarkable finding is that, in the presence of a Dp-brane, both a constant\nparallel NS-NS B-field and R-R C^(p-1)-field do not solve the open/closed\nequations of motion, and induce the same non-vanishing open string tadpole.\nAfter solving the open string equations in the presence of this tadpole, and\nafter gauging away the closed string fields, one is left with a U(1) field\nstrength on the brane given by F=(1/2)(B-*C^(p-1)), where * is Hodge duality\nalong the brane world-volume. One observes that this result differs from the\nusually assumed result F=B. Technically, this is due to the fact that\nsupersymmetric and bosonic string world-sheet theories are different. Note,\nhowever, that the usual F+B combination is still the combination which remains\ngauge invariant at the sigma-model level. Also, the standard result F=B is, in\nthe D3-brane case, not compatible with S-duality. On the other hand our result,\nwhich is derived automatically given the general formalism, offers a\nnon-trivial check of S-duality, to all orders in F, and this leads to a S-dual\ninvariant Moyal deformation.

The first indication of a (possibly) thin\nspot in the wall that prevents us from deriving a priori the U-duality\nsymmetries of these models is to be found in the analysis of the hyperbolic\nbilliards that control the chaotic time evolution of (quasi)homogeneous\nanisotropic String, Supergravity or Einstein cosmologies near a spacelike\nsingularity. What happens is that U-duality symmetry controls chaos via\nnegative constant curvature. On the other hand it was noticed in 1982 that\n(symmetrizable) ''hyperbolic'' Kac-Moody algebras have maximal rank ten,\nexactly like superstring models and that two of these four rank ten algebras\nmatched physical theories. My second reason for optimism actually predates also\nthe previous breakthrough, it was the discovery in 1998 of surprising\nsuperalgebras extending U-dualities to all (p+1)-forms (associated to\np-branes). They have a super-nonlinear sigma model structure similar to the\nsymmetric space structure associated to 0-forms and they obey a universal\nself-duality field equation. As the set of forms is doubled to implement\nelectric-magnetic duality, they obey a set of first order equations. More\nremains to be discovered but the beauty and subtlety of the structure cannot be\na random emergence from chaos. In fact we shall explain how a third maximal\nrank hyperbolic algebra $BE_{10}$ controls heterotic cosmological chaos and how\nas predicted Einstein's General Relativity fits into the general picture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Sep 2002 12:43:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We then argue that the\noptimal basis for both ``primitive'' and partial averaged approaches is the\nWiener sine-Fourier basis. The present analysis also suggests a new approach to\nimproving the convergence of primitive path integral methods. Current work\nindicates that this new technique, the ``reweighted'' method, converges as the\ncube of the number of path variables for ``smooth'' potentials. The technique\nis based on a special way of approximating the Brownian bridge which enters the\nFeynman-Kac formula and it does not require the Gaussian transform of the\npotential for its implementation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Sep 2002 23:57:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Nov 2002 23:32:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Each bacterium is understood as a carrier of a phenotypic\nparameter p. The central aim is the calculation of the probability density with\nrespect to p of the carriers living at time t>0. The theory involves two small\nparameters: the mutation probability $\\mu$ and a parameter $\\gamma$ involved in\na function w(p) defining the fitness of the bacteria to survive the generation\ntime $\\tau$ and give birth to offspring. The mutation from a state p to a state\nq is defined by a Gaussian. The author focuses attention on an equation\ngeneralizing Waxman's equation. The author solves this equation in the standard\nstyle of a perturbation theory and discusses how the solution depends on the\nchoice of the fitness function w(p). In a sense, the function\n$c(p)=1-w(p)/w(0)$ is analogous to the dispersion function E(p) of fictitious\nquasiparticles. With a general function c(p), the distribution function\n${\\mathit\\Phi}(p,t;0)$ is composed of a delta-function component,\n$N(t)\\delta(p)$, and a blurred component. The author shows that asymptotically\nN(t) may tend to a positive value, in contrast with zero resulting from\nWaxman's approximation where $c(p)\\sim p^2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Sep 2002 10:06:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
