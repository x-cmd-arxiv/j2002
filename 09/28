Although deep images from the\nMultiband Imaging Photometer for SIRTF (MIPS) will provide coverage at 24, 70,\nand 160 micron, the bulk of MIPS-detected objects may only have accurate\nphotometry in the shorter wavelength bands due to the confusion noise.\nTherefore, we have explored the potential for constraining the total infrared\n(IR) fluxes of distant galaxies with solely the 24 micron flux density, and for\nthe combination of 24 micron and 70 micron data. We also discuss the inherent\nsystematic uncertainties in making these transitions. Under the assumption that\ndistant star-forming galaxies have IR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) that\nare represented somewhere in the local Universe, the 24 micron data (plus\noptical and X-ray data to allow redshift estimation and AGN rejection)\nconstrains the total IR luminosity to within a factor of 2.5 for galaxies with\n0.4 < z < 1.6. Incorporating the 70 micron data substantially improves this\nconstraint by a factor < 6. Lastly, we argue that if the shape of the IR SED is\nknown (or well constrained; e.g., because of high IR luminosity, or low\nultraviolet/IR flux ratio), then the IR luminosity can be estimated with more\ncertainty.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Sep 2002 16:36:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The algorithm is independent of the origin of\ncoordinates. We show that (1) the graph has one topological end --that is, from\nany point there is exactly one infinite self-avoiding path; (2) the graph has a\nunique connected component if d=2 and d=3 (a tree) and it has infinitely many\ncomponents if d\\ge 4 (a forest); (3) in d=2 and d=3 we construct a bijection\nbetween the points of the Poisson process and Z using the preorder-traversal\nalgorithm. To construct the graph we interpret each point in S as a space-time\npoint (x,r)\\in\\R^{d-1}\\times R. Then a (d-1) dimensional random walk in\ncontinuous time continuous space starts at site x at time r. The first jump of\nthe walk is to point x', at time r'>r, (x',r')\\in S, where r' is the minimal\ntime after r such that |x-x'|<1. All the walks jumping to x' at time r'\ncoalesce with the one starting at (x',r'). Calling (x',r') = \\alpha(x,r), the\ngraph has vertex set S and edges {(s,\\alpha(s)), s\\in S}. This enables us to\nshift the origin of S^o = S + \\delta_0 (the Palm version of S) to another point\nin such a way that the distribution of S^o does not change (to any point if d =\n2 and d = 3; point-stationarity).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Sep 2002 23:58:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 13 Dec 2003 20:08:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-10"}

Whether fixation is possible depends on the overall growth rate of\nthe quasispecies that will form if invasion is successful, rather than on the\nindividual fitness of the invading mutant. The exact fixation probability can\nonly be calculated if the fitnesses of all potential members of the invading\nquasispecies are known. Quasispecies fixation has two important\ncharacteristics: First, a sequence with negative selection coefficient has a\npositive fixation probability as long as it has the potential to grow into a\nquasispecies with an overall growth rate that exceeds the one of the\nestablished quasispecies. Second, the fixation probabilities of sequences with\nidentical fitnesses can nevertheless vary over many orders of magnitudes. Two\napproximations for the probability of fixation are introduced. Both\napproximations require only partial knowledge about the potential members of\nthe invading quasispecies. The performance of these two approximations is\ncompared to the exact fixation probability on a network of RNA sequences with\nidentical secondary structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Sep 2002 00:18:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}
