Additional data for low\nsurface brightness galaxies from the literature are also included for\ncomparison. These data are combined to study the metallicity-luminosity and\nmetallicity-rotation speed correlations for spiral and irregular galaxies. The\nmetallicity luminosity correlation shows its familiar form for these galaxies,\na roughly uniform change in the average present-day O/H abundance of about a\nfactor 100 over 11 magnitudes in B luminosity. However, the O/H - V(rot)\nrelation shows a change in slope at a rotation speed of about 125 km/sec. At\nfaster V(rot), there appears to be no relation between average metallicity and\nrotation speed. At lower V(rot), the metallicity correlates with rotation\nspeed. This change in behavior could be the result of increasing loss of metals\nfrom the smaller galaxies in supernova-driven winds. This idea is tested by\nlooking at the variation in effective yield, derived from observed abundances\nand gas fractions assuming closed box chemical evolution. The effective yields\nderived for spiral and irregular galaxies increase by a factor of 10-20 from\nV(rot) approximately 5 km/sec to V(rot) approximately 300 km/sec, asympotically\nincreasing to approximately constant y(eff) for V(rot) > 150 km/sec.

In order to\nexamine the first formation of stars and dust in galaxies, we model the\nevolution of galaxies in the redshift range of 5<z<20. In particular, we focus\non the interplay between dust formation in Type II supernova ejecta and H2\nproduction on dust grains. Such effect causes an enhancement of star formation\nrate by an order of magnitude on a timescale (~3--5 galactic dynamical times)\nshorter than the Hubble timescale. We also find that about half of the\nradiative energy from stars is reprocessed by dust grains and is finally\nradiated in the far infrared (FIR).

Displacement currents at\ncapacitively coupled contacts are also positively correlated if both contacts\ncontribute to screening of the same excess charge fluctuation. Hybrid normal\nsuperconducting systems provide another example which permits positive\ncorrelations. The conditions for positive correlations differ strongly\ndepending on whether the normal conductor is open and well coupled to the\nsuperconductor or is only weakly coupled via a barrier to the superconductor.\nIn latter case, positive correlations result if the partition noise generated\nby Cooper pairs is overcome by pairs which are broken up and emit one electron\ninto the contacts of interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Sep 2002 12:05:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
