To reach higher Lorentz\nfactors (up to \\gamma ~ 10^5), thicker, denser radiators can be used, which\nconsequently produce x-rays of harder energies (>100 keV). At these energies,\nscintillator detectors are more efficient in detecting the hard x-rays, and\nCompton scattering of the x-rays out of the path of the particle becomes an\nimportant effect.

We report on the development of a framework\nallowing detailed studies with special attention given to the hadronization\nphase. In our model, implemented in the Pythia event generator, the baryon\nnumber violating vertex is associated with the appearance of a junction in the\ncolour confinement field. This allows us to tell where to look for the extra\n(anti)baryon directly associated with the baryon number violating decay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2002 10:52:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The Dirac-Wilson line is as the quantum photon\npropagator of the new QED theory from which we can derive known QED effects\nsuch as the anomalous magnetic moment and the Lamb shift. The one-loop\ncomputation of these effects is simpler and is more accurate than that in the\nconventional QED theory. Furthermore, from the new QED theory, we have derived\na new QED effect. A new formulation of the Bethe-Salpeter (BS) equation solves\nthe difficulties of the BS equation and gives a modified ground state of the\npositronium.

There\nare interesting and unexplained patterns in the data which may lead to a better\nunderstanding of this problem.\n  Second, we discuss a method for transferring the virtual Haken property under\nDehn filling. In particular, we show that if a 3-manifold with torus boundary\nhas a Seifert fibered Dehn filling with hyperbolic base orbifold, then most of\nthe Dehn filled manifolds are virtually Haken.

These systems include two-mode\nsqueezed system, thermal system of a free single particle (where the fictitious\ntilde system is regarded another particle), and the system of two coupling\nharmonic oscillators. The technique of integration within an ordered product\n(IWOP) of operators is used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2002 14:42:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Sep 2002 17:22:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 2002 06:44:05 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 10 Nov 2002 10:00:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
