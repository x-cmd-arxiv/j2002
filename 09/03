We discuss the influence of radiation fields on the\ninterpretation of the He-like triplet line ratios in the low-Z ions, which is\nrelevant for Algol, and the influence of dielectronic satellite lines, which is\nrelevant for Procyon. For the active stars YY Gem, Eps Eri, and HR1099 the low\nf/i ratios can unambiguously be attributed to high densties in the range 1--3\n10^10 cm^-3 at OVII temperatures.

The approximation that the mass and gravity of the central\nstar is negligible for the subsequent motion of the HII region holds for\ndistances much greater than about 100 AU and for the massive cloud cores that\ngive rise to high-mass stars. If the initial ionization and heating is\napproximated to occur instantaneously at t=0, then the subsequent flow (for r\n>> 100 AU) caused by the resulting imbalance between self-gravity and thermal\npressure is self-similar. Because of the steep density profile, pressure\ngradients produce a shock front that travels into the cloud, accelerating the\ngas to supersonic velocities in what has been called the ``champagne phase.''\nWe then study the self-similar solutions of the expansion of HII regions\nembedded in molecular clouds characterized by more general power-law density\ndistributions with exponent 3/2 < n < 3. In these cases, the shock velocity is\nan increasing function of the exponent n, and diverges as n tends to 3.
