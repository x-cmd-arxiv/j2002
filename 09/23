I discuss the main features at each stage and\nparticularly the role of the halo. Bars can form even in sub-maximum discs. In\nfact, such bars can be stronger than bars which have grown in maximum discs.\nThis is due to the response of the halo and, in particular, to the exchange of\nenergy and angular momentum between the disc particles constituting the bar and\nthe halo particles at resonance with it. The bar slowdown depends on the\ninitial central concentration of the halo and the initial value of the disc Q.\nContrary to the halo mass distribution, the disc changes its radial density\nprofile considerably during the evolution. Applying the Sackett criterion, I\nthus find that discs become maximum in many simulations in which they have\nstarted off as sub-maximum. I briefly discuss the evolution if a gaseous\ncomponent is present, as well as the destruction and regeneration of bars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Sep 2002 16:36:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The time evolution of these frequencies and their relation with the\nparameters of the energy spectra reported in Barret & Olive (2002) are used to\nconstrain the accretion geometry changes. The spectral data were fitted by the\nsum of a blackbody and a Comptonized component and were interpreted in the\nframework of a truncated accretion disk geometry, with a varying truncation\nradius. If one assumes that the characteristic frequencies of the Lorentzians\nare some measure of this truncation radius, as in most theoretical models, then\nthe timing data presented here strengthen the above interpretation. The soft to\nhard and hard to soft transitions are clearly associated with the disk receding\nfrom and approaching the neutron star respectively. During the transitions,\ncorrelations are found between the Lorentzian frequencies and the flux and\ntemperature of the blackbody, which is thus likely to be coming from the disk.\nOn the other hand, in the hard state, the characteristic Lorentzians\nfrequencies which are at the lowest, remained nearly constant despite\nsignificant evolution of the spectra parameters.

Pulled fronts\nare fronts that propagate into an unstable state, and the asymptotic front\nspeed is equal to the linear spreading speed $v^*$ of infinitesimal\nperturbations around the unstable state. In this paper, we consider front\npropagation in a simple stochastic lattice model. The microscopic picture of\nthe front dynamics shows that for the description of the far tip of the front,\none has to abandon the idea of a uniformly translating front solution. The\nlattice and finite particle effects lead to a ``halt-and-go'' type dynamics at\nthe far tip of the front, while the average front behind it ``crosses over'' to\na uniformly translating solution. In this formulation, the effect of\nstochasticity on the asymptotic front speed is coded in the probability\ndistribution of the times required for the advancement of the ``foremost\noccupied lattice site''. These probability distributions are obtained by\nmatching the solution of the far tip with the uniformly translating solution\nbehind in a mean-field type approximation, and the results for the probability\ndistributions compare well to the results of stochastic numerical simulations.\nThis approach allows one to deal with much smaller values of $N$ than it is\nrequired to have the $\\ln^{-2}N$ asymptotics to be valid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Sep 2002 21:35:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2002 15:14:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2002 10:26:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The amount of the asymmetry\ndepends crucially on their number density. If the (s)neutrinos are generated\nthermally, in supersymmetric models there is limited parameter space leading to\nenough baryons. For this reason, several alternative mechanisms have been\nproposed. We discuss the nonperturbative production of sneutrino quanta by a\ndirect coupling to the inflaton. This production dominates over the\ncorresponding creation of neutrinos, and it can easily (i.e. even for a rather\nsmall inflaton-sneutrino coupling) lead to a sufficient baryon asymmetry. We\nthen study the amplification of MSSM degrees of freedom, via their coupling to\nthe sneutrinos, during the rescattering phase which follows the nonperturbative\nproduction. This process, which mainly influences the (MSSM) $D-$flat\ndirections, is very efficient as long as the sneutrinos quanta are in the\nrelativistic regime. The rapid amplification of the light degrees of freedom\nmay potentially lead to a gravitino problem.

The technique developed\nenables one to construct new families of integrable potentials for the acoustic\nproblem, in addition to those already known.\n  The acoustic problem produces a non-linear Harry Dym PDE. Using the\ntechnique, we reproduce a pair of simple soliton solutions of this equation.\nThese solutions are further used to construct a new positon solution for this\nPDE. Furthermore, using the dressing chain approach, we build a modified Harry\nDym equation together with its LA-pair.\n  As an application, we construct some singular and non-singular integrable\npotentials (dielectric permitivity) for the Maxwell equations in a 2D\ninhomogeneous medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 2002 15:32:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In particular, the\namplitude of the remnant-burst oscillations, and the corresponding missing\natoms, have prompted speculation as to the formation of a molecular condensate.\nUsing a minimal mean-field model, we find that rogue dissociation, molecular\ndissociation to noncondensate atom pairs, is qualitatively implicated as the\nphysical mechanism responsible for these observations, although very little\nmolecular condensate is formed. Refining the model provides excellent\nquantitative agreement with the experimental remnant-burst oscillations, and\nthe fraction of molecular condensate accounts almost entirely for the measured\natom loss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 2002 15:13:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}
