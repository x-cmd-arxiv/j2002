This metallicity range is relevant to elliptical\ngalaxies. It is shown that the Bulge GCs and integrated light follow the same\ncorrelation between Mg and Fe indices of elliptical galaxies, showing weaker Fe\nindices at given Mg indices with respect to models that assume solar-scaled\nabundances. This similarity is the robust empirical evidence for enhanced\nalpha/Fe ratios in the stellar populations of elliptical galaxies, since the\nglobular clusters are independently known to be alpha-enhanced. The uniqueness\nof this alpha-overabundance solution is checked by exploring the whole range of\nmodel ingredients.

Neutrons may carry ~10% of the overall\nenergy of the protons accelerated beyond E ~ 1 PeV outside the BLR. Ultra-high\nenergy (UHE) gamma rays produced in photomeson interactions of neutrons outside\nthe blob can also escape the BLR. The escaping neutrons, gamma rays and\nneutrinos form a collimated neutral beam with a characteristic opening angle ~\n1/Gamma, where Gamma is the bulk Lorentz factor of the inner jet.

The core ingredient\nof the proposal is a deformation of Lorentz transformations in which also the\nPlanck scale $E_p$ (in addition to the speed-of-light scale $c$) is described\nas an invariant. Just like the introduction of the invariant $c$ requires a\ndeformation of the Galileian transformations into the Lorentz transformations,\nthe introduction of the invariant $E_p$ requires a deformation of the Lorentz\ntransformations, but there is no special class of inertial observers. The\nPierre Auger Observatory and the GLAST space telescope should play a key role\nin future developments of these investigations. I also emphasize that the\ndoubly-special-relativity theory here proposed, besides being the first one to\nprovide a solution for the cosmic-ray puzzle, is also the first one in which a\nnatural description of macroscopic bodies is achieved, and may find\napplications in the context of a recently-proposed dark-energy scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2002 02:03:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-13"}

Studies have been made of the restoration of chiral\nsymmetry in matter and at finite temperature. The phenomenon of deconfinement\nis also of great interest, with studies of the temperature dependence of the\nconfining interaction reported recently. In the present work we study the\nchange of the properties of light mesons as the temperature is increased. For\nthis study we make use of a Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model that has been\ngeneralized to include a covariant model of confinement. The parameters of the\nconfining interaction are made temperature-dependent to take into account what\nhas been learned in lattice simulations of QCD at finite temperature. The\nconstituent quark masses are calculated at finite temperature using the NJL\nmodel. A novel feature of our work is the introduction of a temperature\ndependence of the NJL interaction parameters. (This is a purely\nphenomenological feature of our model, which we do not attempt to derive from\nmore fundamental considerations.) With the three temperature-dependent aspects\nof the model mentioned above, we find that the mesons we study are no longer\nbound when the temperature reaches the critical temperature, $T_c$, which we\ntake to be 170 MeV. We believe that ours is the first model that is able to\ndescribe the interplay of chiral symmetry restoration and deconfinement for\nmesons at finite temperature.

The bifurcation\nin question is nonlocal in the sense that the vector soliton does not have a\nsmall-amplitude component, but instead approaches a solitary wave of one\ncomponent with two infinitely far-separated waves in the other component. Yet,\nit is argued that this highly nonlocal event can be predicted from a purely\nlocal analysis of the central solitary wave alone. Specifically the\nlinearisation around the central wave should contain asymptotics which grow at\nprecisely the speed of the other-component solitary waves on the two wings.\nThis approximate argument is supported by both a detailed analysis based on\nmatched asymptotic expansions, and numerical experiments on two example\nsystems. The first is the usual coupled NLS system involving an arbitrary ratio\nbetween the self-phase and cross-phase modulation terms, and the second is a\ncoupled NLS system with saturable nonlinearity that has recently been\ndemonstrated to support stable multi-peaked solitary waves. The asymptotic\nanalysis further reveals that when the curves which define the proposed\ncriterion for scalar nonlocal bifurcations intersect with boundaries of certain\nlocal bifurcations, the nonlocal bifurcation could turn from scalar to\nnon-scalar at the intersection. This phenomenon is observed in the first\nexample. Lastly, we have also selectively tested the linear stability of\nseveral solitary waves just born out of scalar nonlocal bifurcations. We found\nthat they are linearly unstable. However, they can lead to stable solitary\nwaves through parameter continuation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2002 20:36:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
