We\nthen present a perturbative schema for the associated Fokker-Planck equation\nwhere, in the limit of a vanishingly small noise source, a consistent dynamical\nmodel is obtained. The resulting theory is similar to Quantum Mechanics, having\nthe same field equations for probability measures, the same operator structure\nand symmetric ordering of operators. The model is valid for general\nelectromagnetic interaction as well as many body systems with mutual\ninteractions of general nature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Apr 2002 15:58:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 2002 17:59:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
