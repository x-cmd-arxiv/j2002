We analyze all of the observed radio AGs of GRBs with known\nredshifts, including those of the exceptionally close-by GRB 980425. We also\nstudy in detail the time-evolution of the AGs' spectral index. The agreement\nbetween theory and observations is excellent, even though the CB model is\nextremely frugal in the number of parameters required to explain the radio\nobservations. We propose to use the scintillations in the radio AGs of GRBs to\nverify and measure the hyperluminal speed of their jetted CBs, whose apparent\nangular velocity is of the same order of magnitude as that of galactic pulsars,\nconsistently measured directly, or via scintillations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Apr 2002 12:35:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Jun 2002 13:48:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 23 Nov 2002 15:32:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We present inversion methods leading to the desired $F_2^n$, all using\na parametrization for $C(x,Q^2)=F_2^n(x,Q^2)/F_2^p(x,Q^2)$. Imposing motivated\nconstraints, the simplest parametrization leaves one free parameter\n$C(x=1,Q^2)$. For $Q^2= 3.5 {\\rm GeV}^2$ its average over several targets and\ndifferent methods is $<C(1,3.5)>=0.54\\pm0.03$. We argue that for the\ninvestigated $Q^2$, $C(x\\to 1,3.5)$ is determined by the nucleon-elastic ($NE$)\npart of SF. The calculated value is near the extracted one and both are close\nto the SU(6) limit 2/3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Apr 2002 09:15:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
