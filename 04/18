The feature\nconsists of a narrow peak at 6.4 keV and a broad wing extended between 4.5-7.5\nkeV. An analysis of the long-term variations revealed that the feature became\nvariable only on a time scale longer than 1.5x10^6 s. Through a comparison with\nthe continuum variabilities, we found that the emission region of the excess\nflux at 4.5-7.5 keV has an extent of 10^17 cm. The broad and skewed feature at\n4.5-7.5 keV may be explained by the so-called ``disk-line'' model. If so, the\nsize of the line-emitting region, 10^17 cm, should be equal to several or\nten-times the Schwarzschild radius of the central black hole. This results in a\nblack hole mass of 10^11 solar mass, which may be too large for NGC4151. We\npropose an alternative explanation for the broad and skewed feature, i.e. a\n``reflection'' model, which can also reproduce the overall energy spectra very\nwell. In this model, cold matter with a sufficiently large column density is\nirradiated by X-rays to produce a reflected continuum, which constitutes the\nbroad wing of the feature, and narrow fluorescent lines. The equivalent width\nof the iron fluorescent line (~2 keV) and the upper limit of its width (sigma <\n92 eV) are also consistent with this model. From these results and\nconsiderations, we conclude that the ``disk-line'' model has difficulty to\nexplain the spectral variations of NGC4151, and the reflection model is more\nplausible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Apr 2002 02:47:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}
