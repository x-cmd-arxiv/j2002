We extend previous discussions on the trispectrum and associated weak\nlensing reconstruction from CMB data by calculating non-Gaussian noise\ncontributions, beyond the previously discussed dominant Gaussian noise.\nNon-Gaussian noise contributions are generated by lensing itself and by the\ncorrelation between the lensing effect and other foreground secondary\nanisotropies in the CMB such as the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect.

If the noise-bias due to the dominant\nGaussian part of the temperature squared power spectrum is removed, then these\nadditional non-Gaussian contributions provide the limiting noise level for the\nlensing reconstruction. The temperature squared power spectrum allows a high\nsignal-to-noise extraction of the lensing deflections and a confusion-free\nseparation of the curl (or B-mode) polarization due to inflationary\ngravitational waves from that due to lensed gradient (or E-mode) polarization.\nThe small angular scale temperature and polarization anisotropy measurements\nprovide a novel approach to weak lensing studies, complementing the approach\nbased on galaxy ellipticities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Apr 2002 22:52:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

In this paper we illuminate some of the\ncomplications involved in extracting the outflow's physical conditions\n(ionization equilibrium, total column density, chemical abundances) from such\nspectroscopic data. To do so we use the example provided by high-quality FUSE\nand HST observations of the outflow seen in NGC 985.\n  We show how simple determinations of the column density in the UV absorption\nlines often severely underestimate the real column densities. This is due to\nstrong non-black saturation of the absorption troughs, where in many cases the\nUV line profile mainly reflects the velocity-dependent covering factor rather\nthan the column density distribution. We then show that underestimating\nindividual ionic column densities by a factor of 5 can cause a two orders of\nmagnitude error in the inferred total column density of the outflow. In some\ncase this will be enough to associate the UV and X-ray absorber with the same\noutflowing material.\n  Finally, we note that the UV spectra of NGC 985 have 10--20 times the\nresolution and 2--5$\\times$ the S/N per resolution element compared with the\nbest available Chandra spectra of similar objects. Therefore, in the X-ray band\nnon-black saturation and velocity-dependent covering factor effects will only\nbecome abundantly clear using vastly more capable future X-ray telescopes.\nHowever, by taking into consideration the lessons learned from the UV band, we\ncan greatly improve the quality of physical constraints we extract from current\nX-ray data of AGN outflows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Apr 2002 02:18:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The simulations considered mimic three distinct sets of\nphysical conditions. One of them (run \"ISM\") is intended to represent a mixture\nof cool and warm atomic gas, and includes self-gravity and magnetic fields. For\neach simulation, H I spectral-line maps are synthesized and intercompared, both\nwith each other, and with observations, using the SCF. We find that, when\nthermal broadening is large in comparison with fine-scale turbulent velocity\nstructure, it masks sub-thermal velocity sub-structure in the synthesized\nspectra. The H I observations we use here for comparison are of the North\nCelestial Pole (NCP) Loop. None of the simulations match the NCP Loop data very\nwell. The most realistic sets of line profiles and SCF statistics comes from\nartifically rescaling the velocity axis of run ISM. Without rescaling, almost\nall velocity structure is smeared out by thermal broadening. However, if the\nvelocity axis is expanded by a factor of 6, the SCF distributions of run ISM an\nthe NCP Loop match up fairly well. This means that the ratio of thermal to\nturbulent pressure in run ISM is much too large as it stands, and that the\nsimulation is deficient in turbulent energy. This is a consequence of run ISM\nnot including the effects of supernovae. We conclude that the SCF is a useful\ntool for understanding and fine-tuning simulations of interstellar gas, and in\nparticular that realistic simulations of the atomic ISM need to include the\neffects of energetic stellar winds (e.g. supernovae) in order for the ratio of\nthermal-to-turbulent pressure to give spectra representative of the observed\ninterstellar medium in our Galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Apr 2002 04:32:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Besides the main tree we\nhave also found another group of families of lesser importance around the\nradial 3:1 resonance. The families of this group bifurcate from x1 and\ninfluence the dynamics of the system only locally. We also find that 3D orbits\nelongated along the bar minor axis can be formed by bifurcations of the planar\nx2 family. They can support 3D bar-like structures along the minor axis of the\nmain bar. Banana-like orbits around the stable Lagrangian points build a forest\nof 2D and 3D families as well. The importance of the 3D x1-tree families at the\nouter parts of the bar depends critically on whether they are introduced in the\nsystem as bifurcations in $z$ or in $\\dot{z}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Apr 2002 12:53:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Together with an analysis of the variables involved,\nwe then propose a new theory of small-world networks based on two leading\nconcepts: efficiency and cost. Efficiency measures how well information\npropagates over the network, and cost measures how expensive it is to build a\nnetwork. The combination of these factors leads us to introduce the concept of\n{\\em economic small worlds}, that formalizes the idea of networks that are\n\"cheap\" to build, and nevertheless efficient in propagating information, both\nat global and local scale.

Various complex systems are analyzed, ranging from the realm of\nneural networks, to social sciences, to communication and transportation\nnetworks. In each case, economic small worlds are found.

The approach is based on the use of the instant form of\nrelativistic Hamiltonian dynamics. The main novel feature of this approach is\nthe new method of construction of the matrix element of the electroweak current\noperator. The electroweak current matrix element satisfies the relativistic\ncovariance conditions and in the case of the electromagnetic current also the\nconservation law automatically. The properties of the system as well as the\napproximations are formulated in terms of form factors. The approach makes it\npossible to formulate relativistic impulse approximation in such a way that the\nLorentz--covariance of the current is ensured. In the electromagnetic case the\ncurrent conservation law is also ensured. Our approach gives good results for\nthe pion electromagnetic form factor in the whole range of momentum transfers\navailable for experiments at present time, as well as for lepton decay constant\nof pion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Apr 2002 11:07:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
