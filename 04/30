The halo center of NGC 1399 and NGC 507 is dominated by a bright\nemission peak coincident with the position of the optical galaxy. This central\npeak is not explained by cooling flow models and is likely to be produced by\nkinetically heated stellar material.

At\nlarger distances the halo dynamics is dominated by dark matter extending on\ngroup and cluster scales.

We found\nsignificant density fluctuations in the hot gas distribution of both NGC 1399\nand NGC 507, some of which are explained by the interaction of the\nradio-emitting plasma with the surrounding ISM.

A particular attention is paid to examining if there is an offset\nbetween X-ray centroid and central dominant cD galaxy, which may be an\nindicator of the presence of local dynamical activities of intracluster gas in\nthe central core and therefore, explain the discrepancy between X-ray and\nlensing mass estimates, if any. The unprecedentedly high spatial resolution\nachieved by Chandra allows us to precisely localize the X-ray centroid of Abell\n1689, which appears to coincide perfectly with the central cD galaxy. This\nfact, along with the symmetry and regularity of the X-ray surface brightness\nand temperature distributions, suggests that Abell 1689 is a fully-relaxed\ncluster. We thus employ hydrostatic equilibrium hypothesis to determine the\nprojected mass profile of Abell 1689, and compare it with the results obtained\nby different lensing techniques available in the literature.

The black hole thermodynamics denotes a nice correspondence\nbetween black hole kinematics and the laws of ordinary thermodynamics, but has\nbeen so far considered only in an asymptotically flat case. Does such the\ncorrespondence rely strongly on the feature of the gravity vanishing at the\ninfinity? In order to resolve this question, it should be considered for the\nfirst to extend the Hawking radiation to a case with a dynamical boundary\ncondition like an expanding universe. Therefore the Hawking radiation in an\nexpanding universe is discussed in this paper. As a concrete model of a black\nhole in an expanding universe, we use the swiss cheese universe which is the\nspacetime including a Schwarzschild black hole in the\nFriedmann-Robertson-Walker universe. Further for simplicity, our calculation is\nperformed in two dimension. The resultant spectrum of the Hawking radiation\nmeasured by a comoving observer is generally different from a thermal one. We\nfind that the qualitative behavior of the non-thermal spectrum is of dumping\noscillation as a function of the frequency measured by the observer, and that\nthe intensity of the Hawking radiation is enhanced by the presence of a\ncosmological expansion. It is appropriate to say that it a black hole with an\nasymptotically flat boundary condition stays in a lowest energy thermal\nequilibrium state, and that, once a black hole is put into an expanding\nuniverse, it is excited to a non-equilibrium state and emits its mass energy\nwith stronger intensity than a thermal one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2002 03:50:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Although the system\nhas two lower states, quantum interference is possible because there are\ninterfering pathways to each of the two lower states. The additional\ninterference terms allow for interesting effects such as the suppression of a\ndark state which is present without the interference. Finally we examine a\nnarrow spectral feature in the resonance fluorescence of the atom with quantum\ninterference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Apr 2002 17:21:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Jul 2002 10:01:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

However, they\nthemselves have neglected the experimenter's freedom to choose settings, while\non the other hand, Bell's theorem can be formulated to cope with time-like\ndependence. This in itself proves that their toy model cannot satisfy local\nrealism, but we also indicate where their proof of its local realistic nature\nfails.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2002 12:09:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The\ninternal dynamics of the atomic dipole strongly coupled to the cavity field is\ntreated by a non-perturbative quantum mechanical model, while the effect of the\ncavity on the external motion is described classically in terms of the\nanalytically obtained linear friction and diffusion coefficients. Efficient\ncavity-induced damping is found which leads to steady-state temperatures\nwell-below the Doppler limit. We reveal a mathematical symmetry between the\nresults here and for a similar system where, instead of the atom, the cavity\nfield is pumped. The cooling process is strongly enhanced in a degenerate\nmultimode cavity. Both the temperature and the number of scattered photons\nduring the characteristic cooling time exhibits a significant reduction with\nincreasing number of modes involved in the dynamics. The residual number of\nspontaneous emissions in a cooling time for large mode degeneracy can reach and\neven drop below the limit of a single photon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2002 12:33:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In other words, neither entangled signal states nor\nentangled measurements give any advantage for information capacity. The result\nfollows from an additivity theorem for the capacity of the product of the\ndepolarizing channel with an arbitrary channel.
