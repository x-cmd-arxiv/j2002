Clumps in Photodissociation regions (PDRs) undergo external\nheating which, if rapid, creates strong photoevaporative mass flows off the\nclump surfaces, and drives shocks into the clumps, compressing them to high\ndensities. The clumps lose mass on relatively short timescales. The evolution\nof an individual clump is found to be sensitive to its initial colunm density,\nthe temperature of the heated surface and the ratio of the ``turn-on time''\n$t_{FUV}$ of the heating flux on a clump to its initial sound crossing-time\n$t_{c}$.\n  In this paper, we use spherical 1-D numerical hydrodynamic models as well as\napproximate analytical models to study the evolution of turbulence-generated\nand pressure-confined clumps in PDRs. Turbulent clumps evolve so that their\ncolumn densities are equal to a critical value determined by the local FUV\nfield, and typically have short photoevaporation timescales, $\\sim 10^{4-5}$\nyears for a 1 M$_{\\odot}$ clump in a typical star-forming region.

I\nperform detailed 2-D decomposition of the M31 double nucleus in the Hubble\nSpace Telescope V-band to study the bulge structure and to address competing\nformation scenarios of the eccentric disk. I deblend the double nucleus (P1 and\nP2) and the bulge simultaneously using five Sersic and one Nuker components.

The most\nprominent feature is a \"tongue\" of emission which extends from the central cD\ngalaxy to the northwest and partly overlaps the radio relic. One possibility is\nthat this tongue is produced by Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instabilities through the\ninteraction between the cold gas around the cD galaxy and hot intracluster\nmedium. We estimate the critical velocity and time scale for the KH instability\nto be effective for the cold core around the cD galaxy.

Thus, the other cores are less vulnerable to KH instability.\nAnother possible origin of the tongue is that it is gas which has been uplifted\nby a buoyant bubble of nonthermal plasma that we identify with the observed\nradio relic.
