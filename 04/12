If these jets contain cold protons and heavy ions (as\nin SS433), it is plausible that this component will consist of a narrow\nspectral feature, with a mean particle energy corresponding roughly to the bulk\nkinetic particle energy in the beam, Gamma_jet m c^2, which, based on current\nestimates of Gamma_jet, falls into the range of 3-10 GeV. The presence of\nseveral sources with different Gamma_jet will lead to superposition of several\nsuch peaks. Additionally, diffusive particle acceleration should produce a\npowerlaw whose low energy cutoff at or above Gamma_jet^2 m c^2 would be visible\nas another spectral feature. The large metallicities measured in several\nmicroquasar companions suggest that this CR component could have an anomalous\ncomposition compared to the bulk Galactic CRs. We provide estimates of the\neffects of adiabatic losses, which pose the greatest challenge to models of\nnarrow band CR production in microquasar jets. While the total energy contained\nin the microquasar CR component is highly uncertain, the CR spectrum in the\nvicinity of microquasars would be severely affected. AMS02 will be able to\nprobe the low energy CR spectrum for such components and composition anomalies.\nThe spectrally peculiar gamma-ray emission produced by interaction of the ISM\nwith CRs surrounding microquasars might be detectable by GLAST. If the presence\nof a microquasar CR proton component can be ruled out observationally, this\nargument could be turned around in favor of electron-positron jets.

This identification allows\nfor the consistent generalization of the intrinsic pinch technique to two\nloops, through the collective treatment of entire sets of diagrams, instead of\nthe laborious algebraic manipulation of individual graphs, and sets up the\nstage for the generalization of the method to all orders. We show that the task\nof comparing the effective Green's functions obtained by the Pinch Technique\nwith those computed in the background field method Feynman gauge is\nsignificantly facilitated when employing the powerful quantization framework of\nBatalin and Vilkovisky. This formalism allows for the derivation of a set of\nuseful non-linear identities, which express the Background Field Method Green's\nfunctions in terms of the conventional (quantum) ones and auxiliary Green's\nfunctions involving the background source and the gluonic anti-field; these\nlatter Green's functions are subsequently related by means of a Schwinger-Dyson\ntype of equation to the ghost Green's functions appearing in the aforementioned\nSlavnov-Taylor identity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Apr 2002 16:16:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Jun 2002 18:15:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

This leads\nto a small amount of CP violation from the usual KM mechanism and a significant\ncontribution from supersymmetry is required.

For systems with repulsive (i.e. positive) interaction potentials the\nexperimental low temperature state and the ground state are effectively\nsynonymous -- and this fact is used in all modeling. In such cases, the leading\nterm in the energy/particle is $2\\pi\\hbar^2 a \\rho/m$ where $a$ is the\nscattering length of the two-body potential. Owing to the delicate and peculiar\nnature of bosonic correlations (such as the strange $N^{7/5}$ law for charged\nbosons), four decades of research failed to establish this plausible formula\nrigorously. The only previous lower bound for the energy was found by Dyson in\n1957, but it was 14 times too small. The correct asymptotic formula has\nrecently been obtained by us and this work will be presented. The reason behind\nthe mathematical difficulties will be emphasized. A different formula,\npostulated as late as 1971 by Schick, holds in two-dimensions and this, too,\nwill be shown to be correct. With the aid of the methodology developed to prove\nthe lower bound for the homogeneous gas, two other problems have been\nsuccessfully addressed. One is the proof by us that the Gross-Pitaevskii\nequation correctly describes the ground state in the `traps' actually used in\nthe experiments. For this system it is also possible to prove complete Bose\ncondensation, as we have shown. Another topic is a proof that Foldy's 1961\ntheory of a high density Bose gas of charged particles correctly describes its\nground state energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Apr 2002 19:28:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2003 19:37:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

As a consequence, designing systems to\ncater for change is becoming not only desirable but required by industry.\nAllowing systems to be self-describing or description-driven is one way to\nenable these characteristics. To address the issue of evolvability in designing\nself-describing systems, this paper proposes a pattern-based, object-oriented,\ndescription-driven architecture. The proposed architecture embodies four\npillars - first, the adoption of a multi-layered meta-modeling architecture and\nreflective meta-level architecture, second, the identification of four data\nmodeling relationships that must be made explicit such that they can be\nexamined and modified dynamically, third, the identification of five design\npatterns which have emerged from practice and have proved essential in\nproviding reusable building blocks for data management, and fourth, the\nencoding of the structural properties of the five design patterns by means of\none pattern, the Graph pattern. In this paper the fundamentals of the\ndescription-driven architecture are described - the multi-layered architecture\nand reflective meta-level architecture, remaining detail can be found in the\ncited references. A practical example of this architecture is described,\ndemonstrating the use of description-driven data objects in handling system\nevolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Apr 2002 11:51:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}

Thus in principle, interaction is not\nnecessary for occupation-number entanglement to appear. However, in order to\ncharacterize quantum correlation caused by interaction, we use the eigenstates\nof the single-particle Hamiltonian as the single particle basis upon which the\noccupation-number entanglement is defined. Using the proper single particle\nbasis, we discuss occupation-number entanglement in important eigenstates,\nespecially ground states, of systems of many identical particles. The\ndiscussions on Fermi systems start with Fermi gas, Hatree-Fock approximation,\nand the electron-hole entanglement in excitations. The entanglement in a\nquantum Hall state is quantified as -fln f-(1-f)ln(1-f), where f is the proper\nfractional part of the filling factor. For BCS superconductivity, the\nentanglement is a function of the relative momentum wavefunction of the Cooper\npair, and is thus directly related to the superconducting energy gap. For a\nspinless Bose system, entanglement does not appear in the\nHatree-Gross-Pitaevskii approximation, but becomes important in the Bogoliubov\ntheory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Apr 2002 19:48:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 2002 22:28:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2002 23:28:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 16 Jun 2003 20:01:39 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2004 17:26:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
