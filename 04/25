Thus far, the existence of double bars has been determined\npredominantly through analysis of near infrared images, which can tell us\nlittle about the dynamics and inflow rates of these systems. We have observed\ntwo double bar galaxy candidates (NGC 2273 and NGC 5728) in CO J=1-0 with the\nOwens Valley Radio Observatory Millimeter Array. Despite the similarity in the\nnear infrared images of these galaxies, we see rather different nuclear\nmorphologies in the CO maps. NGC 2273 shows evidence of a nuclear gas bar,\naligned with the nuclear stellar bar seen in the near infrared images. Both the\nnuclear gaseous and stellar bars are misaligned from the large scale bar by\napproximately 90 degrees, which also allows the possibility that both are the\nresult of stars and gas populating the $x_2$ orbits of the primary bar.\nEstimates using dynamical friction arguments and star formation rates suggest\nsignificant gas inflow rates along the nuclear bar of NGC 2273. Conversely, NGC\n5728 does not show any evidence for a nuclear molecular bar, but shows an arc\nof CO clumps that peaks just to the south-west of the dynamical center and\ncurves to the south-east where it follows the dust lane to the south. Models of\ndouble-barred galaxies suggest that these galaxies should contain large amounts\nof molecular gas in their nuclei. Our calculations suggest that both galaxies\ncontain sufficient amounts of gas in their nuclei, but only NGC 2273 shows\nevidence for a nuclear gas bar. This may be the result of past episodes of star\nformation exhausting and dispersing the nuclear gas of NGC 5728, but is more\nlikely evidence that NGC 5728 has undergone a minor merger event.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 2002 16:11:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The sensitivity of statistical properties of inherent\nsaddles to the convergence criteria of the minimisation procedure is\ninvestigated using, as a test system, a simple liquid bound by a quadratically\nshifted Lennard-Jones pair potential with continuous zeroth, first and second\nderivatives at the cut-off distance. The variation in statistical properties of\nsaddles is studied over a range of error tolerances spanning five orders of\nmagnitude. The largest value of the tolerance corresponds to that used for the\nunshifted LJ liquids in a previous work (J. Chem. Phys. {\\bf 115}, 8784\n(2001)).

On the basis of simple\nbead-spring models for the membrane lipids, the peptide, and water, detailed\nprocesses of the peptide insertion is investigated by molecular dynamics\nsimulation; our special concern is in the highly cooperative motions of\nmembrane lipids and the peptide. Our model lipid has a head group of three\nhydrophilic beads and a tail of seven hydrophobic beads, while the model\npeptide is a block-copolymer made of hydrophilic and hydrophobic blocks, with\ntotal length of 200 beads. In addition, each water molecule is represented by a\nsingle bead which has considerably larger interaction energy.

When the peptide molecule is set free to interact with the membrane,\nthe hydrophobic blocks of the peptide strongly favor intimate contact with the\nlipid tails. This strong attractive interaction gives rise to a severe membrane\nperturbation, which leads to the formation of a pore, though short-lived, in\nthe membrane. It is found that the side-surface of the pore is almost covered\nwith the hydrophilic heads of the lipids, which seems to help the hydrophilic\nblocks of the peptide translocate across the membrane.

We demonstrate that there exist transport solutions that yield a\nfreezeout distribution with Rout < Rside for Kperp > ~ 1.5 GeV. These solutions\ncorrespond to continuous evaporation-like freezeout, where the emission\nduration is comparable to the source size. Naively this would mean Rout >\nRside. Nevertheless, our sources exhibit Rout < Rside because they are narrower\nin the 'out' than in the 'side' direction and, in addition, a positive x_out-t\ncorrelation develops reducing Rout further.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 2002 23:48:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-09"}

The latter involves a basic \"cognitive\" function of each species\ngiven by the power of distinction of states within some predefined resolution.\nThe introduction of a realistic background noise limiting the range of the\nfeedback operation yields a pattern signature in fitness space with a\ndistribution of temporal boost/mutation distances according to a randomized\ndevil's staircase function. Introducing a further level in the hierarchy of the\nsystem's rules, the possibility of an adaptive evolutionary change of the\nresolution itself is implemented, thereby providing a time-dependent measure of\nthe species' cognitive abilities: an additional feedback loop makes use of the\ninevitable intrinsic fluctuations within the fitness landscape to direct the\ntemporal change of the resolution. Feeding back the small adaptive changes of\nresolution into the essentially directionless variations of the patterns'\nlifetimes in fitness space effectively leads to a clear tendency towards\nincreasing evolution potentials for each species (\"hierarchically emergent\nfractal evolution\").\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 2002 16:39:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 May 2002 18:45:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

These\noperations correspond to pre-determined combinations of phase corrections and\nbit-flips that are applied to the post-selected output modes of\nnon-deterministic quantum logic devices. Corrections of this kind are required\nin order to obtain the correct logical output for certain detection events, and\ntheir use can increase the overall success probability of the devices. In this\npaper, we report on the experimental demonstration of the use of this type of\nfeed-forward system to increase the probability of success of a simple\nnon-deterministic quantum logic operation from approximately 1/4 to 1/2. This\nlogic operation involves the use of one target qubit and one ancilla qubit\nwhich, in this experiment, are derived from a parametric down-conversion photon\npair. Classical information describing the detection of the ancilla photon is\nfed-forward in real-time and used to alter the quantum state of the output\nphoton. A fiber optic delay line is used to store the output photon until a\npolarization-dependent phase shift can be applied using a high speed Pockels\ncell.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 2002 17:13:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
