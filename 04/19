The nucleus is dominated by a bright, unresolved\nsource, polarized at a level of 6.0 pm 1.2% with a position angle of 122degr pm\n1.5degr. There are two polarized lobes extending up to 8'' northeast and\nsouthwest of the nucleus. The polarized flux in both lobes is quite clumpy,\nwith the maximum polarization occurring in the southwest lobe at a level of 17%\nwhen smoothed to 0.23'' resolution. The perpendiculars to the polarization\nvectors in these two lobes point back to the intense unresolved nuclear source\nto within one 0.076'' Camera 2 pixel, thereby confirming that this is the\nilluminating source of the scattered light and therefore the probable AGN\ncentral engine. Whereas the polarization of the nucleus is probably caused by\ndichroic absorption, the polarization in the lobes is almost certainly caused\nby scattering, with very little contribution from dichroic absorption. Features\nin the polarized lobes include a gap at a distance of about 1'' from the\nnucleus toward the southwest lobe and a ``knot'' of emission about 5''\nnortheast of the nucleus. Both features had been discussed by ground-based\nobservers, but they are much better defined with the high spatial resolution of\nNICMOS. The northeast knot may be the side of a molecular cloud that is facing\nthe nucleus, which cloud may be preventing the expansion of the northeast radio\nlobe at the head of the radio synchrotron-radiation-emitting jet. We also\nreport the presence of two ghosts in the Camera 2 polarizers. These had not\nbeen detected previously (Hines et al. 2000) because they are relatively faint\nand require observations of a source with a large dynamic range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Apr 2002 16:18:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

To this end we explore some general characteristics of\nblazars, GRBs and superluminal galactic sources, such as their bulk Lorentz\nfactors, the power of their jets compared with what they can extract through\naccretion, and the value of the magnetic field, close to the black hole, needed\nto extract the spin energy of a rotating black hole. We find remarkable\nsimilarities, namely that the outflowing mass rate is of the order of 1 per\ncent of the accretion mass rate in all systems, and that the value of the\nmagnetic field required to efficiently extract the spin energy of the black\nhole is of the order of the gravitational energy density of the matter close to\nthe gravitational radius. We then go on to discuss the way in which the energy\nin bulk relativistic motion can be transformed into beamed radiation, and\nconsider the possibility that all three classes of sources could work in the\nsame way, namely by a intermittent release of relativistic plasma at the base\nof the jet and thus with similar efficiency. Different patches of material,\nwith slightly different velocities, collide at some distance from the black\nhole, producing the radiation we see.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Apr 2002 10:10:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

For an\nN-particle Hamiltonian system, with a smooth Hamiltonian of the type p^2 +\nv(q), the evolution of tangent vectors is governed by the Hessian matrix V of\nthe potential. Ergodicity implies that the Lyapunov exponent is independent of\ninitial conditions on the energy shell, which can then be chosen randomly\naccording to the microcanonical distribution. In this way a stochastic process\nV(t) is defined, and the evolution equation for tangent vectors can now be seen\nas a stochastic differential equation. An equation for the evolution of the\naverage squared norm of a tangent vector can be obtained using the standard\ntheory in which the average propagator is written as a cummulant expansion. We\nshow that if cummulants higher than the second one are discarded, the Lyapunov\nexponent can be obtained by diagonalizing a small-dimension matrix, which, in\nsome cases, can be as small as 3x3. In all cases the matrix elements of the\npropagator are expressed in terms of correlation functions of the stochastic\nprocess.

In particular, though\nmeasurements on entangled systems are correlated in a way that cannot be\nreproduced by local hidden variables, they cannot be used for superluminal\nsignalling. As Czachor, Gisin and Polchinski pointed out, this is not true for\ngeneral nonlinear modifications of the Schroedinger equation. Excluding\nsuperluminal signalling has thus been taken to rule out most nonlinear versions\nof quantum theory. The no superluminal signalling constraint has also been used\nfor alternative derivations of the optimal fidelities attainable for imperfect\nquantum cloning and other operations.\n  These results apply to theories satisfying the rule that their predictions\nfor widely separated and slowly moving entangled systems can be approximated by\nnon-relativistic equations of motion with respect to a preferred time\ncoordinate. This paper describes a natural way in which this rule might fail to\nhold. In particular, it is shown that quantum readout devices which display the\nvalues of localised pure states need not allow superluminal signalling,\nprovided that the devices display the values of the states of entangled\nsubsystems as defined in a non-standard, but natural, way. It follows that any\nlocally defined nonlinear evolution of pure states can be made consistent with\nMinkowski causality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Apr 2002 18:32:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2005 17:16:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 6 May 2005 18:12:33 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 11 May 2005 18:37:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-17"}
