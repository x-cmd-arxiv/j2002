The resulting color-magnitude (c-m)\ndiagrams reveal the morphology of the horizontal branch (HB) in this dwarf\ngalaxy. We find that like Andromeda I and Andromeda II, and like most of the\nGalactic dSph companions, the HB morphology of And III is predominantly red,\nredder than that of both And I and And II despite And III having a lower mean\nmetallicity. We interpret this red HB morphology as indicating that the bulk of\nthe And III population is ~3 Gyr younger than the age of the majority of\nGalactic globular clusters. Nevertheless, the And III c-m diagram does reveal a\nfew blue HB stars, and a number of RR Lyrae variables are also evident in the\ndata. This indicates that And III does contain an `old' population of age\ncomparable to that of the Galactic globular clusters. There is no evidence,\nhowever, for any young stars in And III despite a claimed association between\nthis dSph and an HI cloud. As was the case for And II, but not And I, no radial\ngradient was detected in the And III HB morphology. And III is ~75 kpc from the\ncenter of M31, comparable to the Galactocentric distances of Sculptor and\nDraco. Comparison with standard globular cluster red giant branches indicates\n<[Fe/H]> = -1.88 +/-0.11, consistent with the absolute-magnitude - mean\nabundance relation followed by dSph galaxies. The same comparison yields an\nintrinsic abundance dispersion of sigma([Fe/H]) = 0.12, a low value compared to\nthe Galactic dSphs of comparable luminosity to And III. The list of candidate\nvariables reveals one definite and one probable Anomalous Cepheid variables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Apr 2002 03:47:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
