A review of the multiwavelength data from the literature\nreveals no additional sources that contribute to the ionization. We find that\nthe young starburst dominating the UV emission is distinct from the nuclear\npopulation of A supergiants identified in the optical spectrum by Keel (1996).\nSpectral synthesis analysis provides constraints on the physical nature of the\nstarburst, revealing a 5-6 Myr, approximately instantaneous starburst with\nsubsolar metallicity. These results are used to model the spectral energy\ndistribution of the ionizing continuum. Luminosity constraints place limits on\nthe steepness of the extinction curve for the young starburst. The Savage &\nMathis (1979) curve satisfies all luminosity constraints and the derived\nreddening is similar to the emission line reddening. These results imply\nextreme conditions in the nuclear starburst, with ~5x10^4 O and B stars\ncompacted in the inner 9\" x 13\" region of the nucleus. Using photoionization\nanalysis and employing all observational constraints on the emission line gas,\nwe find very specific conditions are required if the spectrum is generated\nsolely by stellar photoionization. At least two spatially distinct components\nare required - a compact region with strong O III emission and an extended, low\ndensity component emitting most of the S II flux. A high density component is\nalso needed to generate the O I flux. Additionally, a limited contribution from\nWolf-Rayet stars to the ionizing SED is necessary, consistent with the results\nof Barth & Shields (2000). We present a physical interpretation for the\nmulti-component emission line gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2002 19:09:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

One, the leading\nBFKL effect is due to the growth of the parton density, and is characterized by\nthe leading BFKL exponent. The other mechanism is due to the infrared\ndiffusion, or the long range nature of the Coulomb field of perturbatively\nmassless gluons. When perturbative saturation effects are taken into account,\nthe first mechanism is rendered ineffective but the second one persists. We\nsuggest that these two distinct mechanisms are responsible for the appearance\nof two pomerons. The density growth effects are responsible for the hard\npomeron and manifest themselves in small systems (e.g. gamma^* or small size\nfluctuations in the proton wave function) where saturation effects are not\nimportant. The soft pomeron is the manifestation of the exponential growth of\nthe black saturated regions which appear in typical hadronic systems. We point\nout that the nonlinear generalization of the BFKL equation which takes into\naccount wave function saturation effects (\"pomeron loops\") provides a well\ndefined perturbative framework for the calculation of the soft pomeron\nintercept. The conjecture of a perturbative soft pomeron is consistent with\npicturing the proton as a loosely bound system of several small black regions\ncorresponding e.g. to constituent quarks of size about 0.3 fm.
