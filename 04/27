The\nobject is remarkable because of its low estimated mass and age and because it\nis associated with a mid-infrared source, an indication of a surrounding dusty\ndisk. Based on the comparison of our spectrum with similar spectra of field\nM-dwarfs and atmospheric models, we obtain revised estimates of the spectral\ntype, effective temperature and luminosity of the central object. These\nparameters are used to place the object on a Hertzprung-Russell diagram and to\ncompare with the prediction of pre-main sequence evolutionary models. Our\nanalysis suggests that the central object has a very low mass, probably below\nthe deuterium burning limit and in the range 8-12MJupiter, and a young age,\nless than 1Myr. The infrared excess is shown to be consistent with the emission\nof a flared, irradiated disk similar to those found in more massive brown dwarf\nand TTauri systems. This result suggests that substellar objects, even the\nso-called isolated planetary mass objects, found in young stellar associations\nare produced in a similar fashion as stars, by core contraction and\ngravitational collapse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Apr 2002 12:55:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The new method utilizes the\nfull-width half maximum (FWHM) of the low-ionization MgII emission line and the\ncorrelation between broad-line region (BLR) radius and continuum luminosity at\n3000 Angstroms. Using archival UV spectra it is found that the correlation\nbetween BLR radius and 3000 Angstrom luminosity is tighter than the established\ncorrelation with 5100 Angstrom luminosity. Furthermore, it is found that the\ncorrelation between BLR radius and 3000 Ang luminosity is consistent with a\nrelation of the form $R_{BLR} \\propto lambda L_{lambda}^{0.5}$, as expected for\na constant ionization parameter. Using a sample of objects with broad-line\nradii determined from reverberation mapping it is shown that the FWHM of MgII\nand H beta are consistent with following an exact one-to-one relation, as\nexpected if both H beta and MgII are emitted at the same radius from the\ncentral ionizing source. The resulting virial black-hole mass estimator based\non rest-frame UV observables is shown to reproduce black-hole mass measurements\nbased on reverberation mapping to within a factor of 2.5 (1 sigma). Finally,\nthe new UV black-hole mass estimator is shown to produce identical results to\nthe established optical (H beta) estimator when applied to 128\nintermediate-redshift (0.3<z<0.9) quasars drawn from the Large Bright Quasar\nSurvey and the radio-selected Molonglo quasar sample.

Numerical predictions for the scattering in the high\n$Q^2$ region obtained from the RIA and five other approximations are presented\nand compared.
