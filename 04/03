We study\nfour different damping mechanisms of the Alfven waves: nonlinear, turbulent,\nviscous-resistive and collisional. Two different possible origins for the\nAlfven waves are discussed: 1) Alfven waves generated at the surface of the\nstar by the shock produced by the infalling matter; and 2) Alfven waves\ngenerated locally in the funnel by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. We find\nthat, in general, the damping lengths are smaller than the tube length. Since\nthermal conduction in the tube is not efficient, Alfven waves generated only at\nthe star's surface cannot heat the tube to the temperatures necessary to fit\nthe observations. Only for very low frequency Alfven waves ~10^{-5} the ion\ncyclotron frequency, is the viscous-resistive damping length greater than the\ntube length. In this case, the Alfven waves produced at the surface of the star\nare able to heat the whole tube. Otherwise, local production of Alfven waves is\nrequired to explain the observations. The turbulence level is calculated for\ndifferent frequencies for optically thin and thick media.

In addition to extracting information in a global sense via tools\nsuch as the power spectrum, the g-beta spectrum and the structure functions we\nexplore the local nature of the PT field by means of the wavelet transform\nmethod. The primary indication is that an initially smooth PT field becomes\nrough (within specified scales), though in a qualitatively sparse fashion.\nSimilarly, initially 1D iso-PT contours (i.e., PT level sets) are seen to\nacquire a fractal nature. Moreover, the dimensions of the iso-PT contours\nsatisfy existing analytical bounds. The expectation that the roughness will\nmanifest itself in the singular nature of the gradient fields is confirmed via\nthe multifractal nature of the dissipation field. Following earlier work on the\nsubject, the singular and oscillatory nature of the gradient field is\ninvestigated by examining the scaling of a probability measure and a sign\nsingular measure respectively. A physically motivated derivation of the\nrelations between the variety of scaling exponents is presented, the aim being\nto bring out some of the underlying assumptions which seem to have gone\nunnoticed in previous presentations.
