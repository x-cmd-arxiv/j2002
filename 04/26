For a bright pair of images straddling a critical curve, the\nsaddlepoint (of the arrival time surface) is much more strongly affected than\nthe associated minimum. With a mass ratio of smooth matter to microlensing\nmatter of 4:1, a saddlepoint with a macro-magnification of mu = 9.5 will spend\nhalf of its time more than a magnitude fainter than predicted. The anomalous\nflux ratio observed for the close pair of images in MG0414+0534 is a factor of\nfive more likely than computed by Witt, Mao and Schechter if the smooth matter\nfraction is as high as 93%. The magnification probability histograms for\nmacro-images exhibit distinctly different structure that varies with the smooth\nmatter content, providing a handle on the smooth matter fraction. Enhanced\nfluctuations can manifest themselves either in the temporal variations of a\nlightcurve or as flux ratio anomalies in a single epoch snapshot of a multiply\nimaged system. While the millilensing simulations of Metcalf and Madau also\ngive larger anomalies for saddlepoints than for minima, the effect appears to\nbe less dramatic for extended subhalos than for point masses.

The analysis considers both the thermal and temporal\nevolution of the ICM which has passed through the bow shock of the radio source\nand the effect of this swept-up gas on the dynamics of the radio source itself.\nThe final state of the swept-up ICM is critcally dependent on the thermal\nconductivity of the gas. If the gas behind the bow shock expands adiabatically,\nand the source is expanding into a steeply falling atmosphere, then a narrow\ndense layer will form as the radio source lifts gas out of the cluster\npotential. This layer has a cooling time very much less than that of the gas\njust ahead of the radio source.

A flatter halo core with $\\alpha <1$ exerts on\nthe satellites tidal compression in all directions, which prevents deposit of\nstripped satellite material in the core region. This makes the satellite orbits\ndecay from the radius where $\\alpha \\sim 1$ to the halo centre with no local\ntidal mass transfer and thus causes a rapid steepening of the inner profile to\n$\\alpha >1$. These tidal effects, the resultant steepening of the profile to a\ncusp, and the stability of this cusp to tandem mergers with compact satellites,\nare demonstrated using N-body simulations. The transition at $\\alpha \\sim 1$ is\nthen addressed using toy models in the limiting cases of impulse and adiabatic\napproximations and using tidal radii for satellites on radial and circular\norbits. In an associated paper we address the subsequent slow convergence from\neither side to an asymptotic stable cusp with $\\alpha \\gsim 1$. Our analysis\nthus implies that an inner cusp is enforced when small haloes are typically\nmore compact than larger haloes, as in the CDM scenario, such that enough\nsatellite material makes it intact into the inner halo and is deposited there.\nWe conclude that a necessary condition for maintaining a flat core, as\nindicated by observations, is that the inner regions of the CDM satellite\nhaloes be puffed up by about 50% such that when they merge into a bigger halo\nthey would be disrupted outside the halo core. This puffing up could be due to\nbaryonic feedback processes in small haloes, which may be stimulated by the\ntidal compression in the halo cores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Apr 2002 13:54:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Dec 2002 17:34:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 27 Jan 2003 22:05:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

We find that the magnetization curve is\nmonotonically increasing for $J_2/J_1 < 0.267949$, where the system under zero\nexternal field is in the antiferromagnetic N\\'eel phase. For larger ratios of\n$J_2/J_1$, various plateaus will appear in the magnetization curve. In\nparticular, in the disordered phase, our result supports the existence of the\n$M/M_{\\rm sat}=1/2$ plateau and predicts a new plateau at $M/M_{\\rm sat}=1/3$.\nBy identifying the onset ratio $J_2/J_1$ for the appearance of the 1/2-plateau\nwith the boundary between the N\\'eel and the spin-disordered phases in zero\nfield, we can determine this phase boundary accurately by this mean-field\ncalculation. Verification of these interesting results would indicate a strong\nconnection between the frustrated antiferromagnetic system and the quantum Hall\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Apr 2002 23:55:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Here a new stability analysis of these two Poincar\\'e-based chaos\ncontrol schemes is given by means of Floquet theory. This approach allows to\ncalculate exactly the stability restrictions occuring for small measurement\ndelays and for an impulse length shorter than the length of the orbit. This is\nof practical experimental relevance; to avoid a selection of the relative\nimpulse length by trial and error, it is advised to investigate whether the\nused control scheme itself shows systematic limitations on the choice of the\nimpulse length. To investigate this point, a Floquet analysis is performed. For\nOGY control the influence of the impulse length is marginal. As an unexpected\nresult, difference control fails when the impulse length is taken longer than a\nmaximal value that is approximately one half of the orbit length for small\nLjapunov numbers and decreases with the Ljapunov number.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Apr 2002 19:49:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Apr 2002 16:43:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 7 May 2008 07:36:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-11"}

In the\nlimit of infinite N, there is a phase transition between a chaotic and an\nordered phase, with a critical phase in between.\n  We argue that the behavior of this system depends significantly on the\ntopology of the network connections.

The\nresults are the first exact Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen correlation functions\nobtained for Lorentz-covariant quantum-mechanical system in moving frames under\nphysically acceptable conditions, i.e., taking into account the localization of\nthe particles during the detection and using the spin opeartor with proper\ntransformation properties under the action of the Lorentz group. Some special\ncases and approximations of the calculated correlation function are given. The\nresulting correlation function can be used as a basis for a proposal of a\ndecisive experiment for a possible existence of a quantum-mechanical preferred\nframe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Apr 2002 11:07:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Nov 2002 13:16:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In the\nfirst part I briefly discuss quantum tunneling, a topic which Misha cherished\nand to which he was repeatedly returning through his career. My task was to\nshow that Misha's work had been deeply woven in the fabric of today's theory.\nThe second part is an attempt to highlight one of many facets of Misha's human\nportrait. In the 1980's, being a refusenik in Moscow, he volunteered to teach\nphysics under unusual circumstances. I present recollections of people who were\ninvolved in this activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Apr 2002 15:06:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-23"}
