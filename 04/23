Transverse oscillations in pressure, density and temperature are\nproduced that are exacerbated by thermal instability when cooling is present,\nforming post--shock `stripes'. These are orthogonal to the classic post--shock\n'ringing' fluctuations. The resulting post--shock `striping' substantially\nmodifies the flow. We discuss three different methods to resolve this problem.\nThese include (1) a method based on artificial viscosity; (2) grid--jittering\nand (3) a new localized oscillation filter that acts on specific grid cells in\nthe shock front. These methods are tested using a radiative wall shock problem\nwith an embedded shear layer. The artificial viscosity method is unsatisfactory\nsince, while it does reduce post--shock ringing, it does not eliminate the\nstripes and the excessive shock broadening renders the calculation of cooling\ninaccurate, resulting in an incorrect shock location. Grid--jittering\neffectively counteracts striping. However, elsewhere on the grid, the shear\nlayer is unphysically diffused and this is highlighted in an extreme case. The\noscillation filter method removes stripes and permits other high velocity\ngradient regions of the flow to evolve in a physically acceptable manner. It\nalso has the advantage of only acting on a small fraction of the cells in a two\nor three dimensional simulation and does not significantly impair performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2002 02:25:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Instead of difference equations\non elements in the matrix used in past studies, polynomial equations with\ncoefficients of elements are used. In a similar fashion, we show that a real\nnormal Toeplitz matrix must be one of four types: symmetric, skew-symmetric,\ncirculant, or skew-circulant. Here we use trigonometric polynomials in the\ncomplex case and algebraic polynomials in the real case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2002 15:25:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Within the context of the linear theory of irreversible\nthermodynamics, such a system will naturally evolve towards a stable stationary\nstate in which the production of entropy within the ecosystem is at a local\nminimum value. It is shown that this extremal condition leads to equations for\nthe stationary (steady) state population dynamics of interacting species, more\ngeneral than those of Lotka-Volterra, and to conditions on the parameters of\nthe community interaction matrix guaranteeing ecosystem stability. The\nparadoxical stability of real complex ecosystems thus has a simple explanation\nwithin the proposed framework. Furthermore, it is shown that the second law of\nthermodynamics constrains the inter- and intra-species interaction coefficients\nin the sense of maintaining stability during evolution from one stationary\nstate to another. A firm connection is thus established between the second law\nof thermodynamics and natural selection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Apr 2002 21:42:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
