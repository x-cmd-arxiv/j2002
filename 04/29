The idea is based on parametric down conversion with a\nsequence of pump pulses generated by a mode-locked laser. We prove\nexperimentally the feasibility of this scheme by performing a Franson-type Bell\ntest using a 2-way interferometer with path-length difference equal to the\ndistance between 2 pump pulses. With this experiment, we can demonstrate\nentanglement for a two-photon state of at least dimension D=11. Finally, we\npropose a feasible experiment to show a Fabry-Perot like effect for a high\ndimensional two-photon state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Apr 2002 15:37:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
