The\nevolution of initially localised ensembles of orbits was probed through lower\norder moments and coarse-grained distribution functions. In the absence of\ntime-dependent perturbations, regular ensembles disperse initially as a power\nlaw in time and only exhibit a coarse-grained approach towards an invariant\nequilibrium over comparatively long times. Chaotic ensembles generally diverge\nexponentially fast on a time scale related to a typical finite time Lyapunov\nexponent, but can exhibit complex behaviour if they are impacted by the effects\nof cantori or the Arnold web. Viewed over somewhat longer times, chaotic\nensembles typical converge exponentially towards an invariant or near-invariant\nequilibrium. This, however, need not correspond to a true equilibrium, which\nmay only be approached over very long time scales. Time-dependent perturbations\ncan dramatically increase the efficiency of phase mixing, both by accelerating\nthe approach towards a near-equilibrium and by facilitating diffusion through\ncantori or along the Arnold web so as to accelerate the approach towards a true\nequilibrium. The efficacy of such perturbations typically scales\nlogarithmically in amplitude, but is comparatively insensitive to most other\ndetails, a conclusion which reinforces the interpretation that the\nperturbations act via a resonant coupling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2002 18:18:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The model is presented by\nits application to Fomalhaut's collisionally replenished dust disk; a recent\n450 micron image of this disk shows a clump embedded within it with a flux ~5\nper cent of the total. The following conclusions are drawn: (i) SED modelling\nis consistent with Fomalhaut's disk having a collisional cascade size\ndistribution extending from bodies 0.2 m in diameter down to 7 micron-sized\ndust. (ii) Collisional lifetime arguments imply that the cascade starts with\nplanetesimals 1.5-4 km in diameter. Any larger bodies must be predominantly\nprimordial. (iii) Constraints on the timescale for the ignition of the cascade\nare consistent with these primordial planetesimals having a distribution that\nextends up to 1000km, resulting in a disk mass of 5-10 times the minimum mass\nsolar nebula. (iv) The debris disk is expected to be intrinsically clumpy,\nsince planetesimal collisions result in dust clumps. The intrinsic clumpiness\nof Fomalhaut's disk is below current detection limits, but could be detectable\nby future observatories such as the ALMA, and could provide the only way of\ndetermining the primordial planetesimal population. (v) The observed clump\ncould have originated in a collision between two runaway planetesimals, both\nlarger than 1400 km diameter. It is unlikely that we should witness such an\nevent unless both the formation of these runaways and the ignition of the\ncollisional cascade occurred within the last ~10 Myr. (vi) Another explanation\nfor Fomalhaut's clump is that ~5 per cent of the planetesimals in the ring are\ntrapped in 1:2 resonance with a planet orbiting at 80 AU.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Apr 2002 13:42:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

It is first of all an important\nquantity in the context of non-linearities, but it also has connections to\nleakage loss, macro-bending loss, and numerical aperture. Single-mode versus\nmulti-mode operation in PCFs can also be studied by comparing effective areas\nof the different modes. We report extensive numerical studies of PCFs with\nvarying air hole size. Our results can be scaled to a given pitch and thus\nprovide a general map of the effective area. We also use the concept of\neffective area to calculate the \"phase\" boundary between the regimes with\nsingle-mode and multi-mode operation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Apr 2002 14:01:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-25"}
