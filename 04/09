We find a number of correlations between fluxes and\nhardnesses in different energy bands. In the hard state, the variability can be\nexplained by softening the overall spectrum with a pivot at 50 keV and another,\nindependent variability pattern where the spectral shape does not change when\nthe luminosity changes. In the soft state, the variability is caused by a\nvariable hard tail of a constant shape superimposed on a constant soft\ncomponent. These variability patterns are in agreement with the\nenergy-dependent rms variability in the two states. We also study in detail\nrecent soft states in 2000-02.

Their spectra are harder in the 1.5-5 keV band but similar or in the 3-12\nkeV band than those of the 1996 soft state whereas the rms variability is\nstronger in all the ASM bands. On the other hand, the 1994 soft state\ntransition observed by BATSE appears very similar to the 1996 one. We interpret\nthe variability patterns by theoretical Comptonization models. In the hard\nstate, the variability appears to be driven mostly by changing flux in seed\nphotons Comptonized in a hot thermal plasma cloud with an approximately\nconstant power supply. In the soft state, the variability is consistent with\nflares of hybrid, thermal/nonthermal, plasma with variable power above a stable\ncold disk. The spectral and timing differences between the 1996 and 2000-02\nsoft states are explained by a decrease of the color disk temperature.

With large\nvalues of C=c_sh/(GL)^0.2, for rms velocity dispersion c_sh in the swept-up\nmatter and shell-driving luminosity L, the pressure in the accumulated gas is\ntoo large to allow collapse during the expansion time. Considering ~5000 models\ncovering a wide range of parameter space, the common properties of shell\ncollapse as a mechanism for triggered star formation are: (1) the time scale is\n4*sqrt(C/2 pi G rho) for ambient midplane density rho, (2) the total fragment\nmass is ~2x10^7 Msun, of which only a small fraction is likely to be molecular,\n(3) the triggering radius is ~2 times the scale height, and the triggering\nprobability is ~0.5 for large OB associations. Star formation triggered by\nshell collapse should be most common in gas-rich galaxies, such as young\ngalaxies or those with late Hubble types.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 2002 02:26:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The idea is to include semantic structures into\nabstract domains in such a way that the refined abstract domain becomes rich\nenough to allow approximate bottom-up and top-down semantics to agree. These\ndomains are known as condensing abstract domains. Substantially, an abstract\ndomain is condensing if goal-driven and goal-independent analyses agree, namely\nno loss of precision is introduced by approximating queries in a\ngoal-independent analysis. We prove that condensation is an abstract domain\nproperty and that the problem of making an abstract domain condensing boils\ndown to the problem of making the domain complete with respect to unification.\nIn a general abstract interpretation setting we show that when concrete domains\nand operations give rise to quantales, i.e. models of propositional linear\nlogic, objects in a complete refined abstract domain can be explicitly\ncharacterized by linear logic-based formulations. This is the case for abstract\ndomains for logic program analysis approximating computed answer substitutions\nwhere unification plays the role of multiplicative conjunction in a quantale of\nidempotent substitutions. Condensing abstract domains can therefore be\nsystematically derived by minimally extending any, generally non-condensing\ndomain, by a simple domain refinement operator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 2002 13:22:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Then from them, an\none-dimensional physical realization and a new multi-dimensional physical\nrealization of N=4 SSQM are respectively obtained by solving the constraint\nconditions. As applications, N=4 dynamical superconformal symmetries, which\npossess both the N=4 supersymmetries and the usual dynamical conformal\nsymmetries, are studied in detail by considering two simple superpotentials k/x\nand \\omega x, and their corresponding superalgebraic structures, which are\nspanned by eight fermionic generators and six bosonic generators, are\nestablished as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 2002 13:15:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
