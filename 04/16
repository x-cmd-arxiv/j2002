When an intrinsic event\nappears in the light curve of Q0957+561A, its twin event (a similar feature) is\nseen in the brightness record of Q0957+561B, and thus, one can measure the\ncorresponding time delay.

In agreement\nwith the Yonehara's idea, if the three pairs of twin events are originated\ninside a standard hybrid source (accretion disk and circumnuclear stellar\nregion), the three measured time delays indicate that they do not come from a\ncommon zone in the source.

Unlike other hot flows, such as advection- and\nconvection-dominated flows and inflow-outflow solutions (ADAFs, CDAFs, and\nADIOS), the properties of the hot settling flow are determined by the spin of\nthe central black hole, but are insensitive to the mass accretion rate.\nTherefore, it may be possible to identify rapidly spinning BHs simply from\ntheir broad-band spectra.\n  Observationally, the hot settling flow around a Kerr hole is somewhat similar\nto other hot flows in that they all have hard, power-law spectra and relatively\nlow luminosities. Thus, most black hole candidates in the low/hard and,\nperhaps, intermediate X-ray state may potentially accrete via the hot settling\nflow.

Our model expectations are consistent with the results (or constraints)\nobtained by all past searches. We estimate the number of orphan afterglows in\nthe first 1500deg^2 field of the SDSS to be about 0.2. The relative beaming\nfactor b_rel is rapidly increasing with the search sensitivity: b_rel ~ 3 for\nthe SDSS sensitivity to transient objects in the northern sky (R ~ 19), ~14 for\nthe past high-z supernova searches (R ~ 23), and ~50 for the sensitivity of the\nSubaru Suprime-Cam (R ~ 26). Predictions are made for the current facilities\nand future projects in X-ray, optical, and radio bands. Among them, the\nsouthern-sky observation of the SDSS (sensitive to transients down to R ~ 23)\ncould detect ~40 orphan afterglows during the five-year operation. Allen\nTelescope Array would find about 200 afterglows in a radio band at ~0.1-1mJy\nwith b_rel ~ 15.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Apr 2002 04:18:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 May 2002 18:22:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The concept of W=0 pairs allows to make qualitative and quantitative\npredictions about the behaviour of interacting many-body systems, a quite\nremarkable and unusual situation.

A canonical transformation\nof the Hamiltonian, valid for clusters and for the full plane, leads to a\nCooper-like equation for the W=0 pairs.

Self-gravity is then included by compactifying the\nbackground space-time. The low energy effective theory below the\ncompactification scale is shown to be bi-metric, with matter coupling to a\ndifferent metric than the geometrically induced metric on the brane.

A scattering\ntheory derivation of the subdynamics of a microsystem interacting through\ncollisions with a macrosystem is given, leading to a master-equation expressed\nin terms of the operator-valued dynamic structure factor, a two-point\ncorrelation function which compactly takes the statistical mechanics properties\nof the macrosystem into account. For the case of a free quantum gas the dynamic\nstructure factor can be exactly calculated and in the long wavelength limit a\nFokker-Planck equation for the description of quantum dissipation and in\nparticular quantum Brownian motion is obtained, where peculiar corrections due\nto quantum statistics can be put into evidence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Apr 2002 15:03:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
