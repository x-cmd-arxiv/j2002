The velocity and velocity dispersion fields\nexhibit a large variety of morphologies: from simple rotating systems to\ncylindrical, disky and triaxial velocity fields, bars and decoupled cores. Most\nof these kinematical signatures do not have counterparts in the light\ndistribution. While some galaxies are consistent with axisymmetry, most are\nmore complex systems than assumed previously. This suggests that the\nkinematical properties of nearby E/S0 galaxies do not agree with the often\nassumed simplistic two-family model, in which the giant non-rotating triaxial\nellipticals are opposed to the fast-rotating axisymmetric faint ellipticals and\nS0s.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Apr 2002 15:44:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

For 100 gauge configurations generated with the Wilson gauge action at $\n\\beta = 5.8 $ on the $ 8^3 \\times 24 $ lattice, we compute quenched quark\npropagators for 12 bare quark masses. The pion decay constant is extracted from\nthe pion propagator, and from which the lattice spacing is determined to be\n0.147 fm. The presence of quenched chiral logarithm in the pion mass is\nconfirmed, and its coefficient is determined to be $ \\delta = 0.203 \\pm 0.014\n$, in agreement with the theoretical estimate in quenched chiral perturbation\ntheory. Further, we obtain the topological susceptibility of these 100 gauge\nconfigurations by measuring the index of the overlap Dirac operator. Using a\nformula due to exact chiral symmetry, we obtain the $ \\eta' $ mass in quenched\nchiral perturbation theory, $ m_{\\eta'} = (901 \\pm 64) $ Mev, and an estimate\nof $ \\delta = 0.197 \\pm 0.027 $, which is in good agreement with that\ndetermined from the pion mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Apr 2002 15:10:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 May 2002 12:41:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-16"}

This leads to a trade--off curve Q(R), where Q(R) qubits per signal\nis the optimal quantum rate for a given classical rate of R bits per signal.\n  Our main result is an explicit characterization of this trade--off function\nby a simple formula in terms of only single signal, perfect fidelity encodings\nof the source.
