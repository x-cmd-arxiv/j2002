For an accreting neutron star in an X-ray\ntransient, the thermal quiescent flux depends sensitively on the amount of\nhydrogen and helium remaining on the surface after an accretion outburst and on\nthe composition of the underlying ashes of previous H/He burning. Because H/He\nhas a higher thermal conductivity, a larger mass of H/He implies a shallower\nthermal gradient through the low density envelope and hence a higher effective\ntemperature for a given core temperature. The mass of residual H and He varies\nfrom outburst to outburst, so the thermal quiescent flux is variable even\nthough the core temperature is constant for timescales < 10 000 yr. Heavy\nelements settle from a H/He envelope in a few hours; we therefore model the\nquiescent envelope as two distinct layers, H/He over heavier elements, and\ntreat the mass of H/He as a free parameter. We find that the emergent thermal\nquiescent flux can vary by a factor of 2 to 3 between different quiescent\nepochs. The variation is more pronounced at lower interior temperatures, making\nsystems with low quiescent luminosities and frequent outbursts, such as SAX\nJ1808.4-3658, ideal candidates from which to observe this effect. We compute,\nfor different ash compositions, the interior temperatures of Cen X-4, Aql X-1,\nand SAX J1808.4-3658. In the case of Aql X-1, the inferred high interior\ntemperature suggests that neutrino cooling contributes to the neutron star's\nthermal balance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Apr 2002 16:23:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

An\nempirical relationship between single-epoch rest-frame optical\nspectrophotometric measurements and the central masses is also presented. The\nUV relationship allows reasonable estimates of the central masses to be made of\nhigh-redshift AGNs and quasars for which these masses cannot be directly or\neasily measured by the techniques applicable to the lower luminosity, nearby\nAGNs.

The build-up\nof dark haloes in CDM models generally consists of an early phase of fast\naccretion and a late phase of slow accretion [where $M_h$ increases with time\napproximately as the expansion rate].

We distinguish\nbetween different boundary conditions (or sectors), the direction and also the\nstrength of the magnetic field. E.g., with a magnetic field in the z-direction\napplied at the origin and ++ boundary conditions, there is a critical field\nstrength B_c (which depends on the anisotropy of the Hamiltonian and the spin\nvalue) with the following properties: for B < B_c there is a unique ground\nstate with a gap, at the critical value, B_c, there are infinitely many\n(droplet) ground states with gapless excitations, and for B>B_c there is again\na unique ground state but now belonging to the continuous spectrum. In\ncontrast, any magnetic field with a non-vanishing component in the xy-plane\nyields a unique ground state, which, depending on the boundary conditions, is\neither an (anti)kink, or an (anti)droplet state. For such fields, i.e., not\naligned with the z-axis, excitations always have a gap and we obtain a rigorous\nlower bound for that gap.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Apr 2002 01:54:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Jun 2002 21:45:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2002 23:45:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Unfortunately, they require strong\ninter-particle interactions lacking in optics. For this reason, it has not\npreviously been possible to perform complete Bell state determination in\noptical systems. In this work, we show how a recently developed quantum\ninterference technique for enhancing optical nonlinearities can make efficient\nBell-state measurement possible. We also discuss weaknesses of the scheme\nincluding why it cannot be used for unconditional quantum teleportation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Apr 2002 23:31:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Jun 2002 23:58:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}
