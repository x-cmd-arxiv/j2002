We show how the classical spiral of Lynden-Bell & Wood\n(1967) in the temperature-energy plane is deformed by rotation. We find that\ngravitational instability occurs sooner in the microcanonical ensemble and\nlater in the canonical ensemble. According to standard turning point arguments,\nthe onset of the collapse coincides with the minimum energy or minimum\ntemperature state in the series of equilibria. Interestingly, it happens to be\nclose to the point of maximum flattening. We determine analytically the\ngeneralization of the singular isothermal solution to the case of a slowly\nrotating configuration.

Quantum Stokes parameters are considered and the\nspectra of their quantum fluctuations are investigated. It is established that\nthe frequency at which the suppression of quantum fluctuations is the greatest\ncan be controlled by adjusting the linear phase difference between pulses. We\nshown that by varying the intensity or the nonlinear phase shift per photon for\none pulse, one can effectively control the suppression of quantum fluctuations\nof the quantum Stokes parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Apr 2002 19:04:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Jan 2004 17:46:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The evolution of this system is governed by a\nmaster equation. The irreversible components of this master equation describe\nthe spontaneous emission of photons from the atom. For many applications, it is\nnecessary to minimize the effect of this irreversible evolution. This can be\nachieved by having a far detuned light field. The drawback of this regime is\nthat making the detuning very large makes the timestep required to solve the\nmaster equation very small, much smaller than the timescale of any significant\nevolution. This makes the problem very numerically intensive. For this reason,\napproximations are used to simulate the master equation which are more\nnumerically tractable to solve. This paper analyses four approximations: The\nstandard adiabatic approximation; a more sophisticated adiabatic approximation\n(not used before); a secular approximation; and a fully quantum dressed-state\napproximation. The advantages and disadvantages of each are investigated with\nrespect to accuracy, complexity and the resources required to simulate. In a\nparameter regime of particular experimental interest, only the sophisticated\nadiabatic and dressed-state approximations agree well with the exact evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 2002 05:59:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Aug 2002 04:25:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 3 Sep 2002 01:56:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
