Both SU(3) standard coherent\nstates, based on choice of highest weight vector as fiducial vector, and\ncertain other specific systems of generalised coherent states, are found to be\nrelevant. A complete analysis is presented, covering all the oscillator\ncoherent states without exception, and amounting to SU(3) harmonic analysis of\nthese states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Apr 2002 10:32:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
