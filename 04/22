As the associated Finslerian Hamiltonian function\nis also obtainable in a clear explicit form, convenient prospects for the\nFinslerian extension of particle dynamics are also opened.

We extend results in a previous paper to more general\ngeometries, and also correct an error in one section of that paper. We\ncalculate the mean squared scalar and electric fields near the focal line of a\nparabolic cylindrical mirror. These quantities are found to grow as inverse\npowers of the distance from the focus. We give a combination of analytic and\nnumerical results for the mean squared fields. In particular, we find that the\nmean squared electric field can be either negative or positive, depending upon\nthe choice of parameters. The case of a negative mean squared electric field\ncorresponds to a repulsive Van der Waals force on an atom near the focus, and\nto a region of negative energy density. Similarly, a positive value corresponds\nto an attractive force and a possibility of atom trapping in the vicinity of\nthe focus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Apr 2002 22:46:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2002 23:00:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

This\ninteraction dominated decoherence limit has previously not found much attention\neven though it is of importance for the emergence of classical behavior in the\nmacroworld, since it will always be the relevant regime for large enough\nseparations between superposed wave packets. The usual golden-rule treatment\nthen does not apply but we can employ a short-time expansion for the free\nmotion while keeping the interaction $H_{\\rm int}$ in full. We thus reveal\ndecoherence as a universal short-time phenomenon largely independent of the\ncharacter of the system as well as the bath. Simple analytical expressions for\nthe decoherence time scales are obtained in the limit in which decoherence is\neven faster than any timescale emerging from the reservoir Hamiltonian $H_{\\rm\nres}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Apr 2002 10:26:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
