First we prove that - as long as N is irreducible - the unit balls of\nthese norms are related in a way similar to the case of fibered 3-manifolds,\nsupporting the conjecture that N is fibered.

It is known that since the two systems\nare independent, no Hilbert space description is possible, i.e. $L\\ne P(H)$,\nthe lattice of closed subspaces of a Hilbert space (theorem 1). We impose five\nconditions on L. Four of them are shown to be physically necessary. The last\none relates the orthogonality between states in each system to the\northo-complementation of L. It can be justified if one assumes that the\northogonality between states in the total system induces the\northo-complementation of L. We prove that if L satisfies these five conditions,\nthen L is the separated product proposed by Aerts in 1982 to describe\nindependent quantum systems (theorem 2). Finally, we give strong arguments to\nexclude the separated product and therefore our last condition. As a\nconsequence, we ask whether among the ca-lattices that satisfy our first four\nbasic necessary conditions, there exists an ortho-complemented one different\nfrom the separated product.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2002 14:40:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Apr 2002 21:04:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 23 Apr 2003 13:09:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
