Due to\ntheir youth, Hyades members are much more chromospherically active than stars\ntraditionally surveyed for planets using high precision radial velocity (RV)\ntechniques. Therefore, we have conducted a detailed investigation of whether\nmagnetic activity of our Hyades target stars will interfere with our ability to\nmake precise RV searches for substellar companions. We measure chromospheric\nactivity (which we take as a proxy for magnetic activity) by computing the\nequivalent of the R'HK activity index from the Ca II K line. <R'HK> is not\nconstant in the Hyades: we confirm that it decreases with increasing\ntemperature in the F stars, and also find it decreases for stars cooler than\nmid-K. We examine correlations between simultaneously measured R'HK and RV\nusing both a classical statistical test and a Bayesian odds ratio test. We find\nthat there is a significant correlation between R'HK and the RV in only 5 of\nthe 82 stars in this sample. Thus, simple Rprime HK-RV correlations will\ngenerally not be effective in correcting the measured RV values for the effects\nof magnetic activity in the Hyades. We argue that this implies long timescale\nactivity variations (of order a few years; i.e., magnetic cycles or growth and\ndecay of plage regions) will not significantly hinder our search for planets in\nthe Hyades if the stars are closely monitored for chromospheric activity.

Upon increasing the strength of\ninteraction suddenly the condensate enters a nonstationary oscillating phase\nwhich starts to develop more vortices. The opposite happens if the strength is\nreduced suddenly. Eventually, the number of vortices attains a final value at\nlarge times. Similarly, the number of vortices increases (decreases) upon a\nsudden reduction (augmentation) in the trapping potential. We also study the\ndecay of vortices when the rotation of the condensate is suddenly stopped. Upon\na free expansion of a rotating BEC with vortices the radius of the vortex core\nincreases more rapidly than the radius of the condensate. This makes the\ncounting and detection of multiple vortex easier after a free expansion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Apr 2002 20:43:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

A splitting of the 133Cs spectrum into three different\nlines, with distinct electronic environments, is observed which emerges\nnaturally from such a situation. Quadrupole effects on 133Cs confirm an\ninhomogeneous distribution of the charge between C60 molecules.

This gives a relationship between the\norder of mixing and the convex hull of the defining polynomial. Using these\nmethods, we show that an algebraic dynamical system for which any shape of\ncardinality three is mixing is mixing of order three, and for any $k\\ge1$\nexhibit examples that are $k$-fold mixing but not $(k+1)$-fold mixing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Apr 2002 10:44:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The\nexample of the transformation from the Lorenz gauge (retarded solutions for\nboth scalar and vector potential) to the Coulomb gauge (instantaneous,\naction-at-a-distance, scalar potential) is treated in detail. A transparent\nexpression is obtained for the vector potential in the Coulomb gauge, with a\nfinite nonlocality in time replacing the expected spatial nonlocality of the\ntransverse current. A class of gauges (v-gauge) is described in which the\nscalar potential propagates at an arbitrary speed v relative to the speed of\nlight. The Lorenz and Coulomb gauges are special cases of the v-gauge. The last\nexamples of gauges and explicit gauge transformation functions are the\nHamiltonian or temporal gauge, the nonrelativistic Poincare or multipolar\ngauge, and the relativistic Fock-Schwinger gauge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Apr 2002 17:52:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2002 18:15:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
