In the first, case, we find one\ninfrared-stable and one unstable renormalization group fixed point. At the\nstable fixed point, detailed balance is dynamically restored, with the two\nnoise strengths becoming asymptotically equal. The ensuing critical behavior is\nthat of the standard equilibrium model H.

An understanding of these mechanisms would allow the\nuse of an electron beam as a polarized radiation probe for magnetic\ncharacterization, like light in MOKE and neutrons in PNR. Here, a mechanism is\ndescribed which, unlike simultaneously occurring processes proposed elsewhere,\npolarizes an unpolarized incident beam without recourse to inelastic processes.\n  A magnetic field leads to a Zeeman term in an electron's Hamiltonian, which\ndepends on the angle theta between the electron's spin vector and the magnetic\nflux. As a result, when an electron wave is incident on the surface of a bulk\nmagnetic material (figure 1,) the wave-number of the transmitted wave depends\non theta. When the conditions of continuity of the wave-function, and of its\nfirst spatial derivative, at the surface, and conservation of particles, are\napplied, an electron reflection coefficient is obtained which also depends on\ntheta. Therefore, some polarizations are preferentially reflected, while others\nare preferentially transmitted. The amplitude reflection and transmission\ncoefficients can readily be converted to intensity coefficients, and averaged\nover an incoherent superposition of electron waves of different theta, e.g. an\nunpolarized incident beam. The reflected polarization is P = -(2 e mu_B V B)/(3\ne^2 V^2 + mu_B^2 B^2), which can take values -1/sqrt(3) <= P <= 1/sqrt(3),\ndepending on the balance between V and B.\n  The analysis can be extended to multi-layers using the theory of Fabry-Perot\netalons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Apr 2002 14:40:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

Many of the most exotic possibilities that\npresently complicate the extraction of a decay bound will be removed if the\nKamLAND reactor antineutrino experiment confirms the large-mixing angle\nsolution to the solar neutrino problem and measures the mixing parameters\nprecisely. Better experimental and theoretical constraints on the $^8$B\nneutrino flux will also play a key role, as will tighter bounds on absolute\nneutrino masses. Though the lifetime limit set by the solar flux is weak, it is\nstill the strongest direct limit on non-radiative neutrino decay. Even so,\nthere is no guarantee (by about eight orders of magnitude) that neutrinos from\nastrophysical sources such as a Galactic supernova or distant Active Galactic\nNuclei will not decay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 2002 22:00:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Jun 2002 22:00:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

This is in contrast to the\nfinite-dimensional case, where entanglement can be distilled in an iterative\nprotocol using two copies at a time.
